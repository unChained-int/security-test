      <title>AI as Cyberattacker</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/ai-as-cyberattacker.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Anthropic&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In mid-September 2025, we detected suspicious activity that later investigation determined to be a highly sophisticated espionage campaign. The attackers used AI’s “agentic” capabilities to an unprecedented degree­&amp;amp;#8212;using AI not just as an advisor, but to execute the cyberattacks themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The threat actor&amp;amp;#8212;­whom we assess with high confidence was a Chinese state-sponsored group&amp;amp;#8212;­manipulated our Claude Code tool into attempting infiltration into roughly thirty global targets and succeeded in a small number of cases. The operation targeted large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies. We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>In March 2024, Mozilla said it was winding down its collaboration with Onerep -- an identity protection service offered with the Firefox web browser that promises to remove users from hundreds of people-search sites -- after KrebsOnSecurity revealed Onerep&amp;apos;s founder had created dozens of people-search services and was continuing to operate at least one of them. Sixteen months later, however, Mozilla is still promoting Onerep. This week, Mozilla announced their partnership with Onerep will officially end next month.</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Google has filed a complaint in court that &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/google-vows-to-stop-scam-e-z-pass-and-usps-texts-plaguing-americans/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;details the scam&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a complaint filed Wednesday, the tech giant accused &amp;amp;#8220;a cybercriminal group in China&amp;amp;#8221; of selling &amp;amp;#8220;phishing for dummies&amp;amp;#8221; kits. The kits help unsavvy fraudsters easily “execute a large-scale phishing campaign,” tricking hordes of unsuspecting people into “disclosing sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or banking information, often by impersonating well-known brands, government agencies, or even people the victim knows.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These branded &amp;amp;#8220;Lighthouse&amp;amp;#8221; kits offer two versions of software, depending on whether bad actors want to launch SMS and e-commerce scams. &amp;amp;#8220;Members may subscribe to weekly, monthly, seasonal, annual, or permanent licenses,&amp;amp;#8221; Google alleged. Kits include &amp;amp;#8220;hundreds of templates for fake websites, domain set-up tools for those fake websites, and other features designed to dupe victims into believing they are entering sensitive information on a legitimate website.&amp;amp;#8221;...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/the-cloudflare-outage-may-be-a-security-roadmap/</link>
      <description>An intermittent outage at Cloudflare on Tuesday briefly knocked many of the Internet&amp;apos;s top destinations offline. Some affected Cloudflare customers were able to pivot away from the platform temporarily so that visitors could still access their websites. But security experts say doing so may have also triggered an impromptu network penetration test for organizations that have come to rely on Cloudflare to block many types of abusive and malicious traffic.</description>

      <title>Legal Restrictions on Vulnerability Disclosure</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/legal-restrictions-on-vulnerability-disclosure.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Kendra Albert gave an &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUe3uUvIyT0&amp;quot;&amp;gt;excellent talk&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; at USENIX Security this year, pointing out that the legal agreements surrounding vulnerability disclosure muzzle researchers while allowing companies to not fix the vulnerabilities&amp;amp;#8212;exactly the opposite of what the responsible disclosure movement of the early 2000s was supposed to prevent. This is the talk.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thirty years ago, a debate raged over whether vulnerability disclosure was good for computer security. On one side, full disclosure advocates argued that software bugs weren&amp;amp;#8217;t getting fixed and wouldn&amp;amp;#8217;t get fixed if companies that made insecure software wasn&amp;amp;#8217;t called out publicly. On the other side, companies argued that full disclosure led to exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities, especially if they were hard to fix. After blog posts, public debates, and countless mailing list flame wars, there emerged a compromise solution: coordinated vulnerability disclosure, where vulnerabilities were disclosed after a period of confidentiality where vendors can attempt to fix things. Although full disclosure fell out of fashion, disclosure won and security through obscurity lost. We&amp;amp;#8217;ve lived happily ever after since...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>The challenge facing security leaders is monumental: Securing environments where failure is not an option. Reliance on traditional security postures, such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) to chase threats after they have already entered the network, is fundamentally risky and contributes significantly to the half-trillion-dollar annual cost of cybercrime.

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Social media has been a familiar, even mundane, part of life for nearly two decades. It can be easy to forget it was not always that way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 2008, social media was just emerging into the mainstream. &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://thefulcrum.us/media-technology/news-literacy-project&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Facebook&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; reached &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.cnet.com/culture/facebook-hits-100-million-users/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;100 million users&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that summer. And a singular candidate was integrating social media into his political campaign: Barack Obama. His campaign&amp;amp;#8217;s use of social media was so bracingly innovative, so impactful, that it was viewed by journalist &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2008/08/19/219185/how-obama-really-did-it-2/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;David Talbot&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and others as the strategy that enabled the first term Senator to win the White House...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Beyond IAM Silos: Why the Identity Security Fabric is Essential for Securing AI and Non-Human Identities</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/beyond-iam-silos-why-identity-security.html</link>
      <description>Identity security fabric (ISF) is a unified architectural framework that brings together disparate identity capabilities.
