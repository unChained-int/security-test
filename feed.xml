      <description>Cyber threats didn’t slow down last week—and attackers are getting smarter. We’re seeing malware hidden in virtual machines, side-channel leaks exposing AI chats, and spyware quietly targeting Android devices in the wild.
But that’s just the surface. From sleeper logic bombs to a fresh alliance between major threat groups, this week’s roundup highlights a clear shift: cybercrime is evolving fast</description>

      <title>New Attacks Against Secure Enclaves</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/new-attacks-against-secure-enclaves.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Encryption can protect data at rest and data in transit, but does nothing for data in use. What we have are secure enclaves. I&amp;amp;#8217;ve &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/2023/12/decoupling-for-security.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;written about&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; this before:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Almost all cloud services have to perform some computation on our data. Even the simplest storage provider has code to copy bytes from an internal storage system and deliver them to the user. End-to-end encryption is sufficient in such a narrow context. But often we want our cloud providers to be able to perform computation on our raw data: search, analysis, AI model training or fine-tuning, and more. Without expensive, esoteric techniques, such as secure multiparty computation protocols or homomorphic encryption techniques that can perform calculations on encrypted data, cloud servers require access to the unencrypted data to do anything useful...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>According to the new Browser Security Report 2025, security leaders are discovering that most identity, SaaS, and AI-related risks converge in a single place, the user’s browser. Yet traditional controls like DLP, EDR, and SSE still operate one layer too low.
What’s emerging isn’t just a blindspot. It’s a parallel threat surface: unmanaged extensions acting like supply chain implants, GenAI</description>

      <title>Drilling Down on Uncle Sam’s Proposed TP-Link Ban</title>
      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/drilling-down-on-uncle-sams-proposed-tp-link-ban/</link>
      <description>The U.S. government is reportedly preparing to ban the sale of wireless routers and other networking gear from TP-Link Systems, a tech company that currently enjoys an estimated 50% market share among home users and small businesses. Experts say while the proposed ban may have more to do with TP-Link&amp;apos;s ties to China than any specific technical threats, much of the rest of the industry serving this market also sources hardware from China and ships products that are insecure fresh out of the box.</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the past few decades, it&amp;amp;#8217;s become easier and easier to create fake receipts. Decades ago, it required special paper and printers&amp;amp;#8212;I remember a company in the UK advertising its services to people trying to cover up their affairs. Then, receipts became computerized, and faking them required some artistic skills to make the page look realistic.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, AI can &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ai-generated-receipts-make-submitting-fake-expenses-easier/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;do it all&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Several receipts shown to the FT by expense management platforms demonstrated the realistic nature of the images, which included wrinkles in paper, detailed itemization that matched real-life menus, and signatures...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Rigged Poker Games</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/rigged-poker-games.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Department of Justice has &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.wsj.com/sports/nba-illegal-gambling-poker-games-3e7988e4?st=ArwBJd&amp;amp;#038;reflink=article_copyURL_share&amp;amp;#038;utm_source=substack&amp;amp;#038;utm_medium=email&amp;quot;&amp;gt;indicted&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; thirty-one people over the high-tech rigging of high-stakes poker games.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a typical legitimate poker game, a dealer uses a shuffling machine to shuffle the cards randomly before dealing them to all the players in a particular order.  As set forth in the indictment, the rigged games used altered shuffling machines that contained hidden technology allowing the machines to read all the cards in the deck.  Because the cards were always dealt in a particular order to the players at the table, the machines could determine which player would have the winning hand. This information was transmitted to an off-site member of the conspiracy, who then transmitted that information via cellphone back to a member of the conspiracy who was playing at the table, referred to as the &amp;amp;#8220;Quarterback&amp;amp;#8221; or &amp;amp;#8220;Driver.&amp;amp;#8221;  The Quarterback then secretly signaled this information (usually by prearranged signals like touching certain chips or other items on the table) to other co-conspirators playing at the table, who were also participants in the scheme.  Collectively, the Quarterback and other players in on the scheme (i.e., the cheating team) used this information to win poker games against unwitting victims, who sometimes lost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time. The defendants used other cheating technology as well, such as a chip tray analyzer (essentially, a poker chip tray that also secretly read all cards using hidden cameras), an x-ray table that could read cards face down on the table, and special contact lenses or eyeglasses that could read pre-marked cards. ...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

Financial institutions are facing a new reality: cyber-resilience has passed from being a best practice, to an operational necessity, to a prescriptive regulatory requirement.

      <description>Cybercrime has stopped being a problem of just the internet — it’s becoming a problem of the real world. Online scams now fund organized crime, hackers rent violence like a service, and even trusted apps or social platforms are turning into attack vectors.
The result is a global system where every digital weakness can be turned into physical harm, economic loss, or political leverage.</description>

Criminals use social engineering to steal people&amp;amp;#8217;s credentials, and then divert direct deposits into accounts that they control. Sometimes they do other things to make it harder for the victim to realize what is happening.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I feel like this kind of thing is happening everywhere, with everything. As we move more of our personal and professional lives online, we enable criminals to subvert the very systems we rely on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Cyberattacks are getting smarter and harder to stop. This week, hackers used sneaky tools, tricked trusted systems, and quickly took advantage of new security problems—some just hours after being found. No system was fully safe.
From spying and fake job scams to strong ransomware and tricky phishing, the attacks came from all sides. Even encrypted backups and secure areas were put to the test.</description>

      <title>AI Summarization Optimization</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/ai-summarization-optimization.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These days, the most important meeting attendee isn’t a person: It’s the AI notetaker.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This system assigns action items and determines the importance of what is said. If it becomes necessary to revisit the facts of the meeting, its summary is treated as impartial evidence.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But clever meeting attendees can manipulate this system’s record by speaking more to what the underlying AI weights for summarization and importance than to their colleagues. As a result, you can expect some meeting attendees to use language more likely to be captured in summaries, timing their interventions strategically, repeating key points, and employing formulaic phrasing that AI models are more likely to pick up on. Welcome to the world of AI summarization optimization (AISO)...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
