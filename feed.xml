The world now knows what the four thieves (two burglars and two accomplices) realized as recently as last week: The museum&amp;amp;#8217;s Apollo Gallery, which housed the stolen items, was monitored by a single outdoor camera angled away from its only exterior point of entry, a balcony. In other words, a free-roaming Roomba could have provided the world&amp;amp;#8217;s most famous museum with more information about the interior of this space. There is no surveillance footage of the break-in...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

Here’s how that false sense of security</description>

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Operating from their base in Jakarta, where permissive export laws have allowed their surveillance business to flourish, First Wap&amp;amp;#8217;s European founders and executives have quietly built a phone-tracking empire, with a footprint extending from the Vatican to the Middle East to Silicon Valley.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It calls its proprietary system Altamides, which it describes in promotional materials as &amp;amp;#8220;a unified platform to covertly locate the whereabouts of single or multiple suspects in real-time, to detect movement patterns, and to detect whether suspects are in close vicinity with each other.&amp;amp;#8221;...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of those living with facial differences tell WIRED they have undergone multiple surgeries and experienced stigma for their entire lives, which is now being echoed by the technology they are forced to interact with. They say they haven&amp;amp;#8217;t been able to access public services due to facial verification services failing, while others have struggled to access financial services.
