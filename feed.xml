      <description>The Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as COLDRIVER has been attributed to a fresh round of ClickFix-style attacks designed to deliver two new &amp;quot;lightweight&amp;quot; malware families tracked as BAITSWITCH and SIMPLEFIX.
Zscaler ThreatLabz, which detected the new multi-stage ClickFix campaign earlier this month, described BAITSWITCH as a downloader that ultimately drops SIMPLEFIX, a</description>

      <title>Crash Tests for Security: Why BAS Is Proof of Defense, Not Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/crash-tests-for-security-why-bas-is.html</link>
      <description>Car makers don’t trust blueprints. They smash prototypes into walls. Again and again. In controlled conditions.
Because design specs don’t prove survival. Crash tests do. They separate theory from reality. Cybersecurity is no different. Dashboards overflow with “critical” exposure alerts. Compliance reports tick every box.&amp;amp;nbsp;
But none of that proves what matters most to a CISO:

      <title>Digital Threat Modeling Under Authoritarianism</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/09/digital-threat-modeling-under-authoritarianism.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today&amp;amp;#8217;s world requires us to make complex and nuanced decisions about our digital security. Evaluating when to use a secure messaging app like Signal or WhatsApp, which passwords to store on your smartphone, or what to share on social media requires us to assess risks and make judgments accordingly. Arriving at any conclusion is an exercise in threat modeling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In security, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://shostack.org/resources/threat-modeling&amp;quot;&amp;gt;threat modeling&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is the process of determining what security measures make sense in your particular situation. It&amp;amp;#8217;s a way to think about potential risks, possible defenses, and the costs of both. It&amp;amp;#8217;s how experts avoid being distracted by irrelevant risks or overburdened by undue costs...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apple has introduced a new hardware/software security feature in the iPhone 17: &amp;amp;#8220;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://security.apple.com/blog/memory-integrity-enforcement/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Memory Integrity Enforcement&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;,&amp;amp;#8221; targeting the memory safety vulnerabilities that spyware products like Pegasus tend to use to get unauthorized system access. From &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.wired.com/story/apple-iphone-17-memory-integrity-enforcement/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Wired&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In recent years, a movement has been steadily growing across the global tech industry to address a ubiquitous and insidious type of bugs known as memory-safety vulnerabilities. A computer&amp;amp;#8217;s memory is a shared resource among all programs, and memory safety issues crop up when software can pull data that should be off limits from a computer&amp;amp;#8217;s memory or manipulate data in memory that shouldn&amp;amp;#8217;t be accessible to the program. When developers&amp;amp;#8212;­even experienced and security-conscious developers&amp;amp;#8212;­write software in ubiquitous, historic programming languages, like C and C++, it&amp;amp;#8217;s easy to make mistakes that lead to memory safety vulnerabilities.
