      <title>Daniel Miessler on the AI Attack/Defense Balance</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/daniel-miessler-on-the-ai-attack-defense-balance.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;His &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://danielmiessler.com/blog/will-ai-help-moreattackers-defenders&amp;quot;&amp;gt;conclusion&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Context wins&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically whoever can see the most about the target, and can hold that picture in their mind the best, will be best at finding the vulnerabilities the fastest and taking advantage of them. Or, as the defender, applying patches or mitigations the fastest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And if you’re on the inside you know what the applications do. You know what’s important and what isn’t. And you can use all that internal knowledge to fix things­&amp;amp;#8212;hopefully before the baddies take advantage.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Summary and prediction&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Attackers will have the advantage for 3-5 years. For less-advanced defender teams, this will take much longer.
...&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New report: &amp;amp;#8220;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://datasociety.net/library/scam-gpt/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Scam GPT: GenAI and the Automation of Fraud&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;amp;#8221;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This primer maps what we currently know about generative AI’s role in scams, the communities most at risk, and the broader economic and cultural shifts that are making people more willing to take risks, more vulnerable to deception, and more likely to either perpetuate scams or fall victim to them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;AI-enhanced scams are not merely financial or technological crimes; they also exploit social vulnerabilities ­ whether short-term, like travel, or structural, like precarious employment. This means they require social solutions in addition to technical ones. By examining how scammers are changing and accelerating their methods, we hope to show that defending against them will require a constellation of cultural shifts, corporate interventions, and eff­ective legislation...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Microsoft is calling attention to a new phishing campaign primarily aimed at U.S.-based organizations that has likely utilized code generated using large language models (LLMs) to obfuscate payloads and evade security defenses.

      <description>Cybersecurity researchers have discovered what has been described as the first-ever instance of a malicious Model Context Protocol (MCP) server spotted in the wild, raising software supply chain risks.
According to Koi Security, a legitimate-looking developer managed to slip in rogue code within an npm package called &amp;quot;postmark-mcp&amp;quot; that copied an official Postmark Labs library of the same name.</description>

      <description>The Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as COLDRIVER has been attributed to a fresh round of ClickFix-style attacks designed to deliver two new &amp;quot;lightweight&amp;quot; malware families tracked as BAITSWITCH and SIMPLEFIX.

      <title>Crash Tests for Security: Why BAS Is Proof of Defense, Not Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/crash-tests-for-security-why-bas-is.html</link>
      <description>Car makers don’t trust blueprints. They smash prototypes into walls. Again and again. In controlled conditions.
Because design specs don’t prove survival. Crash tests do. They separate theory from reality. Cybersecurity is no different. Dashboards overflow with “critical” exposure alerts. Compliance reports tick every box.&amp;amp;nbsp;
But none of that proves what matters most to a CISO:

      <title>Digital Threat Modeling Under Authoritarianism</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/09/digital-threat-modeling-under-authoritarianism.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today&amp;amp;#8217;s world requires us to make complex and nuanced decisions about our digital security. Evaluating when to use a secure messaging app like Signal or WhatsApp, which passwords to store on your smartphone, or what to share on social media requires us to assess risks and make judgments accordingly. Arriving at any conclusion is an exercise in threat modeling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In security, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://shostack.org/resources/threat-modeling&amp;quot;&amp;gt;threat modeling&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is the process of determining what security measures make sense in your particular situation. It&amp;amp;#8217;s a way to think about potential risks, possible defenses, and the costs of both. It&amp;amp;#8217;s how experts avoid being distracted by irrelevant risks or overburdened by undue costs...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
