      <description>Every year, weak passwords lead to millions in losses — and many of those breaches could have been stopped.
Attackers don’t need advanced tools; they just need one careless login.
For IT teams, that means endless resets, compliance struggles, and sleepless nights worrying about the next credential leak.

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Citizen Lab has &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2025/10/ai-enabled-io-aimed-at-overthrowing-iranian-regime/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;uncovered&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; a coordinated AI-enabled influence operation against the Iranian government, probably conducted by Israel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Key Findings&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A coordinated network of more than 50 inauthentic X profiles is conducting an AI-enabled influence operation. The network, which we refer to as &amp;amp;#8220;PRISONBREAK,&amp;amp;#8221; is spreading narratives inciting Iranian audiences to revolt against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;While the network was created in 2023, almost all of its activity was conducted starting in January 2025, and continues to the present day.
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The profiles&amp;amp;#8217; activity appears to have been synchronized, at least in part, with the military campaign that the Israel Defense Forces conducted against Iranian targets in June 2025.

      <description>For years, security leaders have treated artificial intelligence as an “emerging” technology, something to keep an eye on but not yet mission-critical. A new Enterprise AI and SaaS Data Security Report by AI &amp;amp;amp; Browser Security company LayerX proves just how outdated that mindset has become. Far from a future concern, AI is already the single largest uncontrolled channel for corporate data</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;His &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://danielmiessler.com/blog/will-ai-help-moreattackers-defenders&amp;quot;&amp;gt;conclusion&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Context wins&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Basically whoever can see the most about the target, and can hold that picture in their mind the best, will be best at finding the vulnerabilities the fastest and taking advantage of them. Or, as the defender, applying patches or mitigations the fastest.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And if you’re on the inside you know what the applications do. You know what’s important and what isn’t. And you can use all that internal knowledge to fix things­&amp;amp;#8212;hopefully before the baddies take advantage.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Summary and prediction&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Attackers will have the advantage for 3-5 years. For less-advanced defender teams, this will take much longer.
...&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Running a SOC often feels like drowning in alerts. Every morning, dashboards light up with thousands of signals; some urgent, many irrelevant. The job is to find the real threats fast enough to keep cases from piling up, prevent analyst burnout, and maintain client or leadership confidence.
The toughest challenges, however, aren’t the alerts that can be dismissed quickly, but the ones that hide</description>
