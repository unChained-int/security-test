&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Below, co-authors Bruce Schneier and Nathan E. Sanders share five key insights from their new book, &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;What&amp;amp;#8217;s the big idea?&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;AI can be used both for and against the public interest within democracies. It is already being used in the governing of nations around the world, and there is no escaping its continued use in the future by leaders, policy makers, and legal enforcers. How we wire AI into democracy today will determine if it becomes a tool of oppression or empowerment...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>A design firm is editing a new campaign video on a MacBook Pro. The creative director opens a collaboration app that quietly requests microphone and camera permissions. MacOS is supposed to flag that, but in this case, the checks are loose. The app gets access anyway.

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The team started with a basic test: use AI tools to design variants of the toxin ricin, then test them against the software that is used to screen DNA orders. The results of the test suggested there was a risk of dangerous protein variants slipping past existing screening software, so the situation was treated like the equivalent of a zero-day vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <title>ThreatsDay Bulletin: DNS Poisoning Flaw, Supply-Chain Heist, Rust Malware Trick and New RATs Rising</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/threatsday-bulletin-dns-poisoning-flaw.html</link>
      <description>The comfort zone in cybersecurity is gone. Attackers are scaling down, focusing tighter, and squeezing more value from fewer, high-impact targets. At the same time, defenders face growing blind spots &amp;amp;mdash; from spoofed messages to large-scale social engineering.
This week&amp;amp;rsquo;s findings show how that shrinking margin of safety is redrawing the threat landscape. Here&amp;amp;rsquo;s what&amp;amp;rsquo;s</description>

      <description>BeyondTrust’s annual cybersecurity predictions point to a year where old defenses will fail quietly, and new attack vectors will surge.
Introduction
The next major breach won’t be a phished password. It will be the result of a massive, unmanaged identity debt. This debt takes many forms: it’s the “ghost” identity from a 2015 breach lurking in your IAM, the privilege sprawl from thousands of new</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Signal has &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://signal.org/blog/spqr/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;just rolled out&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; its quantum-safe cryptographic implementation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ultimately, the architects settled on a creative solution. Rather than bolt KEM onto the existing double ratchet, they allowed it to remain more or less the same as it had been. Then they used the new quantum-safe ratchet to implement a parallel secure messaging system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, when the protocol encrypts a message, it sources encryption keys from both the classic Double Ratchet and the new ratchet. It then mixes the two keys together (using a cryptographic key derivation function) to get a new encryption key that has all of the security of the classical Double Ratchet but now has quantum security, too...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Aisuru Botnet Shifts from DDoS to Residential Proxies</title>
      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/</link>
      <description>Aisuru, the botnet responsible for a series of record-smashing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this year, recently was overhauled to support a more low-key, lucrative and sustainable business: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic. Experts says a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.</description>

The world now knows what the four thieves (two burglars and two accomplices) realized as recently as last week: The museum&amp;amp;#8217;s Apollo Gallery, which housed the stolen items, was monitored by a single outdoor camera angled away from its only exterior point of entry, a balcony. In other words, a free-roaming Roomba could have provided the world&amp;amp;#8217;s most famous museum with more information about the interior of this space. There is no surveillance footage of the break-in...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

Here’s how that false sense of security</description>
