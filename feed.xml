&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We pointed a commercial-off-the-shelf satellite dish at the sky and carried out the most comprehensive public study to date of geostationary satellite communication. A shockingly large amount of sensitive traffic is being broadcast unencrypted, including critical infrastructure, internal corporate and government communications, private citizens&amp;amp;#8217; voice calls and SMS, and consumer Internet traffic from in-flight wifi and mobile networks. This data can be passively observed by anyone with a few hundred dollars of consumer-grade hardware. There are thousands of geostationary satellite transponders globally, and data from a single transponder may be visible from an area as large as 40% of the surface of the earth...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>TLDR
Even if you take nothing else away from this piece, if your organization is evaluating passkey deployments, it is insecure to deploy synced passkeys.

Synced passkeys inherit the risk of the cloud accounts and recovery processes that protect them, which creates material enterprise exposure.

      <title>Apple’s Bug Bounty Program</title>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apple is now offering a &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/apple-ups-the-reward-for-finding-major-exploits-to-2-million/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;$2M&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.csoonline.com/article/4071044/apple-bumps-rce-bug-bounties-to-2m-to-counter-commercial-spyware-vendors.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;bounty&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for a zero-click exploit. According to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://security.apple.com/blog/apple-security-bounty-evolved/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;the Apple website&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today we’re announcing the next major chapter for Apple Security Bounty, featuring the industry’s highest rewards, expanded research categories, and a flag system for researchers to objectively demonstrate vulnerabilities and obtain accelerated awards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We’re doubling our top award to $2 million for exploit chains that can achieve similar goals as sophisticated mercenary spyware attacks. This is an unprecedented amount in the industry and the largest payout offered by any bounty program we’re aware of ­ and our bonus system, providing additional rewards for Lockdown Mode bypasses and vulnerabilities discovered in beta software, can more than double this reward, with a maximum payout in excess of $5 million. We’re also doubling or significantly increasing rewards in many other categories to encourage more intensive research. This includes $100,000 for a complete Gatekeeper bypass, and $1 million for broad unauthorized iCloud access, as no successful exploit has been demonstrated to date in either category.
...&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/npm-pypi-and-rubygems-packages-found.html</link>
      <description>Cybersecurity researchers have identified several malicious packages across npm, Python, and Ruby ecosystems that leverage Discord as a command-and-control (C2) channel to transmit stolen data to actor-controlled webhooks.
Webhooks on Discord are a way to post messages to channels in the platform without requiring a bot user or authentication, making them an attractive mechanism for attackers to</description>

      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/researchers-expose-ta585s-monsterv2.html</link>
      <description>Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a previously undocumented threat actor called TA585 that has been observed delivering an off-the-shelf malware called MonsterV2 via phishing campaigns.
The Proofpoint Threat Research Team described the threat activity cluster as sophisticated, leveraging web injections and filtering checks as part of its attack chains.

      <description>Every week, the cyber world reminds us that silence doesn’t mean safety. Attacks often begin quietly — one unpatched flaw, one overlooked credential, one backup left unencrypted. By the time alarms sound, the damage is done.
This week’s edition looks at how attackers are changing the game — linking different flaws, working together across borders, and even turning trusted tools into weapons.</description>

We can already see how different groups of political actors are approaching AI. Professional campaigners are using AI to accelerate the traditional tactics of electioneering; organizers are using it to reinvent how movements are built; and citizens are using it both to express themselves and amplify their side&amp;amp;#8217;s messaging. Because there are so few rules, and so little prospect of regulatory action, around AI&amp;amp;#8217;s role in politics, there is no oversight of these activities, and no safeguards against the dramatic potential impacts for our democracy...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
