&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Criminal actors typically will contact their victims through text message claiming they have kidnapped their loved one and demand a ransom be paid for their release. Oftentimes, the criminal actor will express significant claims of violence towards the loved one if the ransom is not paid immediately. The criminal actor will then send what appears to be a genuine photo or video of the victim&amp;amp;#8217;s loved one, which upon close inspection often reveals inaccuracies when compared to confirmed photos of the loved one. Examples of these inaccuracies include missing tattoos or scars and inaccurate body proportions. Criminal actors will sometimes purposefully send these photos using timed message features to limit the amount of time victims have to analyze the images...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>AI vs. Human Drivers</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/ai-vs-human-drivers.html</link>

      <title>How to Streamline Zero Trust Using the Shared Signals Framework</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/how-to-streamline-zero-trust-using.html</link>
      <description>Zero Trust helps organizations shrink their attack surface and respond to threats faster, but many still struggle to implement it because their security tools don’t share signals reliably. 88% of organizations admit they’ve suffered significant challenges in trying to implement such approaches, according to Accenture.
