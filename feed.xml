      <description>From Detection to Resolution: Why the Gap Persists
A critical vulnerability is identified in an exposed cloud asset. Within hours, five different tools alert you about it: your vulnerability scanner, XDR, CSPM, SIEM, and CMDB each surface the issue in their own way, with different severity levels, metadata, and context.
What’s missing is a system of action. How do you transition from the</description>

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of those living with facial differences tell WIRED they have undergone multiple surgeries and experienced stigma for their entire lives, which is now being echoed by the technology they are forced to interact with. They say they haven&amp;amp;#8217;t been able to access public services due to facial verification services failing, while others have struggled to access financial services. Social media filters and face-unlocking systems on phones often won&amp;amp;#8217;t work, they say...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Why You Should Swap Passwords for Passphrases</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/why-you-should-swap-passwords-for.html</link>
      <description>The advice didn&amp;apos;t change for decades: use complex passwords with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. The idea is to make passwords harder for hackers to crack via brute force methods. But more recent guidance shows our focus should be on password length, rather than complexity. Length is the more important security factor, and passphrases are the simplest way to get your users to create</description>

      <description>Artificial intelligence (AI) holds tremendous promise for improving cyber defense and making the lives of security practitioners easier. It can help teams cut through alert fatigue, spot patterns faster, and bring a level of scale that human analysts alone can’t match. But realizing that potential depends on securing the systems that make it possible.

      <description>ClickFix, FileFix, fake CAPTCHA — whatever you call it, attacks where users interact with malicious scripts in their web browser are a fast-growing source of security breaches.&amp;amp;nbsp;
ClickFix attacks prompt the user to solve some kind of problem or challenge in the browser — most commonly a CAPTCHA, but also things like fixing an error on a webpage.&amp;amp;nbsp;

      <title>Agentic AI’s OODA Loop Problem</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/agentic-ais-ooda-loop-problem.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;The OODA loop&amp;amp;#8212;for observe, orient, decide, act&amp;amp;#8212;is a framework to understand decision-making in adversarial situations. We apply the same framework to artificial intelligence agents, who have to make their decisions with untrustworthy observations and orientation. To solve this problem, we need new systems of input, processing, and output integrity.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many decades ago, U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd introduced the concept of the &amp;amp;#8220;OODA loop,&amp;amp;#8221; for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. These are the four steps of real-time continuous decision-making. Boyd developed it for fighter pilots, but it&amp;amp;#8217;s long been applied in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. An AI agent, like a pilot, executes the loop over and over, accomplishing its goals iteratively within an ever-changing environment. This is Anthropic&amp;amp;#8217;s definition: &amp;amp;#8220;Agents are models using tools in a loop.&amp;amp;#8221;...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a coordinated campaign that leveraged 131 rebranded clones of a WhatsApp Web automation extension for Google Chrome to spam Brazilian users at scale.
The 131 spamware extensions share the same codebase, design patterns, and infrastructure, according to supply chain security company Socket. The browser add-ons collectively have about 20,905 active users.

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We pointed a commercial-off-the-shelf satellite dish at the sky and carried out the most comprehensive public study to date of geostationary satellite communication. A shockingly large amount of sensitive traffic is being broadcast unencrypted, including critical infrastructure, internal corporate and government communications, private citizens&amp;amp;#8217; voice calls and SMS, and consumer Internet traffic from in-flight wifi and mobile networks. This data can be passively observed by anyone with a few hundred dollars of consumer-grade hardware. There are thousands of geostationary satellite transponders globally, and data from a single transponder may be visible from an area as large as 40% of the surface of the earth...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>The danger isn’t that AI agents have bad days — it’s that they never do. They execute faithfully, even when what they’re executing is a mistake. A single misstep in logic or access can turn flawless automation into a flawless catastrophe.

      <title>How Attackers Bypass Synced Passkeys</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/how-attackers-bypass-synced-passkeys.html</link>
      <description>TLDR
Even if you take nothing else away from this piece, if your organization is evaluating passkey deployments, it is insecure to deploy synced passkeys.

Synced passkeys inherit the risk of the cloud accounts and recovery processes that protect them, which creates material enterprise exposure.
Adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) kits can force authentication fallbacks that circumvent strong</description>

      <title>Apple’s Bug Bounty Program</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/apples-bug-bounty-program.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apple is now offering a &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/apple-ups-the-reward-for-finding-major-exploits-to-2-million/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;$2M&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.csoonline.com/article/4071044/apple-bumps-rce-bug-bounties-to-2m-to-counter-commercial-spyware-vendors.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;bounty&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for a zero-click exploit. According to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://security.apple.com/blog/apple-security-bounty-evolved/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;the Apple website&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today we’re announcing the next major chapter for Apple Security Bounty, featuring the industry’s highest rewards, expanded research categories, and a flag system for researchers to objectively demonstrate vulnerabilities and obtain accelerated awards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We’re doubling our top award to $2 million for exploit chains that can achieve similar goals as sophisticated mercenary spyware attacks. This is an unprecedented amount in the industry and the largest payout offered by any bounty program we’re aware of ­ and our bonus system, providing additional rewards for Lockdown Mode bypasses and vulnerabilities discovered in beta software, can more than double this reward, with a maximum payout in excess of $5 million. We’re also doubling or significantly increasing rewards in many other categories to encourage more intensive research. This includes $100,000 for a complete Gatekeeper bypass, and $1 million for broad unauthorized iCloud access, as no successful exploit has been demonstrated to date in either category.
...&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>
