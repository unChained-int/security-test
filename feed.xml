      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/experts-warn-of-widespread-sonicwall.html</link>
      <description>Cybersecurity company Huntress on Friday warned of &amp;quot;widespread compromise&amp;quot; of SonicWall SSL VPN devices to access multiple customer environments.
&amp;quot;Threat actors are authenticating into multiple accounts rapidly across compromised devices,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;The speed and scale of these attacks imply that the attackers appear to control valid credentials rather than brute-forcing.&amp;quot;

      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/hackers-turn-velociraptor-dfir-tool.html</link>
      <description>Threat actors are abusing Velociraptor, an open-source digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) tool, in connection with ransomware attacks likely orchestrated by Storm-2603 (aka CL-CRI-1040 or Gold Salem), which is known for deploying the Warlock and LockBit ransomware.
The threat actor&amp;apos;s use of the security utility was documented by Sophos last month. It&amp;apos;s assessed that the attackers</description>

      <description>The world&amp;apos;s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&amp;amp;#038;T, Comcast and Verizon, new evidence suggests. Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet&amp;apos;s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.</description>

      <title>Autonomous AI Hacking and the Future of Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/autonomous-ai-hacking-and-the-future-of-cybersecurity.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;AI agents are now hacking computers. They&amp;amp;#8217;re getting better at all phases of cyberattacks, faster than most of us expected. They can chain together different aspects of a cyber operation, and hack autonomously, at computer speeds and scale. This is going to change everything.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the summer, hackers proved the concept, industry institutionalized it, and criminals operationalized it. In June, AI company XBOW took the &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-ai-xbow-tops-hackerone-us-leaderboad&amp;quot;&amp;gt;top spot&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on HackerOne&amp;amp;#8217;s US leaderboard after submitting over 1,000 new vulnerabilities in just a few months.

      <description>The SOC of 2026 will no longer be a human-only battlefield. As organizations scale and threats evolve in sophistication and velocity, a new generation of AI-powered agents is reshaping how Security Operations Centers (SOCs) detect, respond, and adapt.
But not all AI SOC platforms are created equal.

      <description>Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a nefarious campaign targeting WordPress sites to make malicious JavaScript injections that are designed to redirect users to sketchy sites.
&amp;quot;Site visitors get injected content that was drive-by malware like fake Cloudflare verification,&amp;quot; Sucuri researcher Puja Srivastava said in an analysis published last week.

      <title>Flok License Plate Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/flok-license-plate-surveillance.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The company Flok is &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.jalopnik.com/1982690/police-flock-cameras-sued-for-tracking-man-526-times/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;surveilling us&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; as we drive:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A retired veteran named Lee Schmidt wanted to know how often Norfolk, Virginia&amp;amp;#8217;s 176 Flock Safety automated license-plate-reader cameras were tracking him. The answer, according to a &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26101033-norfolk_flock/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;U.S. District Court&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; lawsuit filed in September, was more than four times a day, or 526 times from mid-February to early July. No, there&amp;amp;#8217;s no warrant out for Schmidt&amp;amp;#8217;s arrest, nor is there a warrant for Schmidt&amp;amp;#8217;s co-plaintiff, Crystal Arrington, whom the system tagged 849 times in roughly the same period.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You might think this sounds like it violates the Fourth Amendment, which protects American citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures without probable cause. Well, so does the American Civil Liberties Union. Norfolk, Virginia Judge Jamilah LeCruise also agrees, and in 2024 she ruled that plate-reader data obtained without a search warrant couldn&amp;amp;#8217;t be used against a defendant in a robbery case...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>AI-Enabled Influence Operation Against Iran</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/ai-enabled-influence-operation-against-iran.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Citizen Lab has &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://citizenlab.ca/2025/10/ai-enabled-io-aimed-at-overthrowing-iranian-regime/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;uncovered&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; a coordinated AI-enabled influence operation against the Iranian government, probably conducted by Israel.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Key Findings&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;A coordinated network of more than 50 inauthentic X profiles is conducting an AI-enabled influence operation. The network, which we refer to as &amp;amp;#8220;PRISONBREAK,&amp;amp;#8221; is spreading narratives inciting Iranian audiences to revolt against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;While the network was created in 2023, almost all of its activity was conducted starting in January 2025, and continues to the present day.
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;The profiles&amp;amp;#8217; activity appears to have been synchronized, at least in part, with the military campaign that the Israel Defense Forces conducted against Iranian targets in June 2025.
...&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>For years, security leaders have treated artificial intelligence as an ‚Äúemerging‚Äù technology, something to keep an eye on but not yet mission-critical.
