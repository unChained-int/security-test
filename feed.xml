      <title>Aisuru Botnet Shifts from DDoS to Residential Proxies</title>
      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/</link>
      <description>Aisuru, the botnet responsible for a series of record-smashing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this year, recently was overhauled to support a more low-key, lucrative and sustainable business: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic. Experts says a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.</description>

The faster you learn about emerging threats, the faster you adapt your defenses, the less damage you suffer, and the more confidently your business keeps scaling. Early threat detection isn’t about preventing a breach someday: it’s about protecting the revenue you’re supposed to earn every day.

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your highway toll payment is now past due, one text warns. You have U.S. Postal Service fees to pay, another threatens. You owe the New York City Department of Finance for unpaid traffic violations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The texts are ploys to get unsuspecting victims to fork over their credit-card details. The gangs behind the scams take advantage of this information to buy iPhones, gift cards, clothing and cosmetics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Criminal organizations operating out of China, which investigators blame for the toll and postage messages, have used them to make more than $1 billion over the last three years, according to the Department of Homeland Security...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

In other words, a free-roaming Roomba could have provided the world&amp;amp;#8217;s most famous museum with more information about the interior of this space.

      <description>Security, trust, and stability — once the pillars of our digital world — are now the tools attackers turn against us. From stolen accounts to fake job offers, cybercriminals keep finding new ways to exploit both system flaws and human behavior.
Each new breach proves a harsh truth: in cybersecurity, feeling safe can be far more dangerous than being alert.
Here’s how that false sense of security</description>

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It calls its proprietary system Altamides, which it describes in promotional materials as &amp;amp;#8220;a unified platform to covertly locate the whereabouts of single or multiple suspects in real-time, to detect movement patterns, and to detect whether suspects are in close vicinity with each other.&amp;amp;#8221;...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of those living with facial differences tell WIRED they have undergone multiple surgeries and experienced stigma for their entire lives, which is now being echoed by the technology they are forced to interact with. They say they haven&amp;amp;#8217;t been able to access public services due to facial verification services failing, while others have struggled to access financial services.

      <description>The advice didn&amp;apos;t change for decades: use complex passwords with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. The idea is to make passwords harder for hackers to crack via brute force methods. But more recent guidance shows our focus should be on password length, rather than complexity. Length is the more important security factor, and passphrases are the simplest way to get your users to create</description>

      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/polaredge-targets-cisco-asus-qnap.html</link>
      <description>Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on the inner workings of a botnet malware called PolarEdge.
PolarEdge was first documented by Sekoia in February 2025, attributing it to a campaign targeting routers from Cisco, ASUS, QNAP, and Synology with the goal of corralling them into a network for an as-yet-undetermined purpose.
