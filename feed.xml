      <title>Use of Generative AI in Scams</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/use-of-generative-ai-in-scams.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New report: &amp;amp;#8220;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://datasociety.net/library/scam-gpt/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Scam GPT: GenAI and the Automation of Fraud&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;amp;#8221;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This primer maps what we currently know about generative AI’s role in scams, the communities most at risk, and the broader economic and cultural shifts that are making people more willing to take risks, more vulnerable to deception, and more likely to either perpetuate scams or fall victim to them.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;AI-enhanced scams are not merely financial or technological crimes; they also exploit social vulnerabilities ­ whether short-term, like travel, or structural, like precarious employment. This means they require social solutions in addition to technical ones. By examining how scammers are changing and accelerating their methods, we hope to show that defending against them will require a constellation of cultural shifts, corporate interventions, and eff­ective legislation...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Bitdefender’s 2025 Cybersecurity Assessment Report paints a sobering picture of today’s cyber defense landscape: mounting pressure to remain silent after breaches, a gap between leadership and frontline teams, and a growing urgency to shrink the enterprise attack surface.

      <description>The Problem: Legacy SOCs and Endless Alert Noise
Every SOC leader knows the feeling: hundreds of alerts pouring in, dashboards lighting up like a slot machine, analysts scrambling to keep pace.

      <title>Details of a Scam</title>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Longtime Crypto-Gram readers know that I collect &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/02/details-of-a-phone-scam.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;personal experiences&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of people being scammed. Here&amp;amp;#8217;s an &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/18/nyregion/zelle-chase-banking-scam.html?unlocked_article_code=1.nE8.mifp.13j7oh96HfpC&amp;amp;#038;smid=url-share&amp;amp;#038;utm_source=substack&amp;amp;#038;utm_medium=email&amp;quot;&amp;gt;almost&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Then he added, &amp;amp;#8220;Here at Chase, we&amp;amp;#8217;ll never ask for your personal information or passwords.&amp;amp;#8221; On the contrary, he gave me more information&amp;amp;#8212;two &amp;amp;#8220;cancellation codes&amp;amp;#8221; and a long case number with four letters and 10 digits.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;amp;#8217;s when he offered to transfer me to his supervisor. That simple phrase, familiar from countless customer-service calls, draped a cloak of corporate competence over this unfolding drama. His &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;supervisor&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;. I mean, would a scammer have a supervisor?...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Car makers don’t trust blueprints. They smash prototypes into walls. Again and again. In controlled conditions.
Because design specs don’t prove survival. Crash tests do. They separate theory from reality. Cybersecurity is no different. Dashboards overflow with “critical” exposure alerts. Compliance reports tick every box.&amp;amp;nbsp;
But none of that proves what matters most to a CISO:

      <title>Digital Threat Modeling Under Authoritarianism</title>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today&amp;amp;#8217;s world requires us to make complex and nuanced decisions about our digital security. Evaluating when to use a secure messaging app like Signal or WhatsApp, which passwords to store on your smartphone, or what to share on social media requires us to assess risks and make judgments accordingly. Arriving at any conclusion is an exercise in threat modeling.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In security, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://shostack.org/resources/threat-modeling&amp;quot;&amp;gt;threat modeling&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; is the process of determining what security measures make sense in your particular situation. It&amp;amp;#8217;s a way to think about potential risks, possible defenses, and the costs of both. It&amp;amp;#8217;s how experts avoid being distracted by irrelevant risks or overburdened by undue costs...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

The charges came as Jubair and an alleged co-conspirator appeared in a London court to face accusations of hacking into and extorting several large U.K. retailers, the London transit system, and healthcare providers in the United States.</description>

      <title>US Disrupts Massive Cell Phone Array in New York</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/09/us-disrupts-massive-cell-phone-array-in-new-york.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4w0d8zz22o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;weird story&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The US Secret Service disrupted a network of telecommunications devices that could have shut down cellular systems as leaders gather for the United Nations General Assembly in New York City.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The agency said on Tuesday that last month it found more than 300 SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards that could have been used for telecom attacks within the area encompassing parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8220;This network had the power to disable cell phone towers and essentially shut down the cellular network in New York City,&amp;amp;#8221; said special agent in charge Matt McCool...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>
