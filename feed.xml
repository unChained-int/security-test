      <title>Aisuru Botnet Shifts from DDoS to Residential Proxies</title>
      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/</link>
      <description>Aisuru, the botnet responsible for a series of record-smashing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this year, recently was overhauled to support a more low-key, lucrative and sustainable business: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic. Experts says a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.</description>

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Your highway toll payment is now past due, one text warns. You have U.S. Postal Service fees to pay, another threatens. You owe the New York City Department of Finance for unpaid traffic violations.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The texts are ploys to get unsuspecting victims to fork over their credit-card details. The gangs behind the scams take advantage of this information to buy iPhones, gift cards, clothing and cosmetics.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Criminal organizations operating out of China, which investigators blame for the toll and postage messages, have used them to make more than $1 billion over the last three years, according to the Department of Homeland Security...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of those living with facial differences tell WIRED they have undergone multiple surgeries and experienced stigma for their entire lives, which is now being echoed by the technology they are forced to interact with. They say they haven&amp;amp;#8217;t been able to access public services due to facial verification services failing, while others have struggled to access financial services.
