      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In his 2020 book, &amp;amp;#8220;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://global.oup.com/academic/product/future-politics-9780198825616?cc=ca&amp;amp;#38;lang=en&amp;amp;#38;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Future Politics&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;,&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8221; British barrister Jamie Susskind wrote that the dominant question of the 20th century was &amp;amp;#8220;How much of our collective life should be determined by the state, and what should be left to the market and civil society?&amp;amp;#8221; But in the early decades of this century, Susskind suggested that we face a different question: &amp;amp;#8220;To what extent should our lives be directed and controlled by powerful digital systems&amp;amp;#8212;and on what terms?&amp;amp;#8221;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) forces us to confront this question. It is a technology that in theory amplifies the power of its users: A manager, marketer, political campaigner, or opinionated internet user can utter a single instruction, and see their message&amp;amp;#8212;whatever it is&amp;amp;#8212;instantly written, personalized, and propagated via email, text, social, or other channels to thousands of people within their organization, or millions around the world. It also allows us to individualize solicitations for political donations, elaborate a grievance into a well-articulated policy position, or tailor a persuasive argument to an identity group, or even a single person...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
