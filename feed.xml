      <title>On Hacking Back</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/on-hacking-back.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Former DoJ attorney John Carlin &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.aspendigital.org/blog/so-you-want-to-hack-back/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;writes&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; about hackback, which he defines thus: &amp;amp;#8220;A hack back is a type of cyber response that incorporates a counterattack designed to proactively engage with, disable, or collect evidence about an attacker. Although hack backs can take on various forms, they are&amp;amp;#8212;­by definition­&amp;amp;#8212;not passive defensive measures.&amp;amp;#8221;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;His conclusion:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As the law currently stands, specific forms of purely defense measures are authorized so long as they affect only the victim’s system or data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the other end of the spectrum, offensive measures that involve accessing or otherwise causing damage or loss to the hacker’s systems are likely prohibited, absent government oversight or authorization. And even then parties should proceed with caution in light of the heightened risks of misattribution, collateral damage, and retaliation...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A new attack called &amp;amp;#8216;CometJacking&amp;amp;#8217; exploits URL parameters to pass to Perplexity&amp;amp;#8217;s Comet AI browser hidden instructions that allow access to sensitive data from connected services, like email and calendar.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a realistic scenario, no credentials or user interaction are required and a threat actor can leverage the attack by simply exposing a maliciously crafted URL to targeted users.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <title>New Attacks Against Secure Enclaves</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/new-attacks-against-secure-enclaves.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Encryption can protect data at rest and data in transit, but does nothing for data in use. What we have are secure enclaves. I&amp;amp;#8217;ve &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/2023/12/decoupling-for-security.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;written about&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; this before:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Almost all cloud services have to perform some computation on our data. Even the simplest storage provider has code to copy bytes from an internal storage system and deliver them to the user. End-to-end encryption is sufficient in such a narrow context. But often we want our cloud providers to be able to perform computation on our raw data: search, analysis, AI model training or fine-tuning, and more. Without expensive, esoteric techniques, such as secure multiparty computation protocols or homomorphic encryption techniques that can perform calculations on encrypted data, cloud servers require access to the unencrypted data to do anything useful...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/drilling-down-on-uncle-sams-proposed-tp-link-ban/</link>
      <description>The U.S. government is reportedly preparing to ban the sale of wireless routers and other networking gear from TP-Link Systems, a tech company that currently enjoys an estimated 50% market share among home users and small businesses. Experts say while the proposed ban may have more to do with TP-Link&amp;apos;s ties to China than any specific technical threats, much of the rest of the industry serving this market also sources hardware from China and ships products that are insecure fresh out of the box.</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the past few decades, it&amp;amp;#8217;s become easier and easier to create fake receipts. Decades ago, it required special paper and printers&amp;amp;#8212;I remember a company in the UK advertising its services to people trying to cover up their affairs. Then, receipts became computerized, and faking them required some artistic skills to make the page look realistic.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, AI can &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/ai-generated-receipts-make-submitting-fake-expenses-easier/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;do it all&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Several receipts shown to the FT by expense management platforms demonstrated the realistic nature of the images, which included wrinkles in paper, detailed itemization that matched real-life menus, and signatures...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Rigged Poker Games</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/rigged-poker-games.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Department of Justice has &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.wsj.com/sports/nba-illegal-gambling-poker-games-3e7988e4?st=ArwBJd&amp;amp;#038;reflink=article_copyURL_share&amp;amp;#038;utm_source=substack&amp;amp;#038;utm_medium=email&amp;quot;&amp;gt;indicted&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; thirty-one people over the high-tech rigging of high-stakes poker games.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a typical legitimate poker game, a dealer uses a shuffling machine to shuffle the cards randomly before dealing them to all the players in a particular order.  As set forth in the indictment, the rigged games used altered shuffling machines that contained hidden technology allowing the machines to read all the cards in the deck.  Because the cards were always dealt in a particular order to the players at the table, the machines could determine which player would have the winning hand. This information was transmitted to an off-site member of the conspiracy, who then transmitted that information via cellphone back to a member of the conspiracy who was playing at the table, referred to as the &amp;amp;#8220;Quarterback&amp;amp;#8221; or &amp;amp;#8220;Driver.&amp;amp;#8221;  The Quarterback then secretly signaled this information (usually by prearranged signals like touching certain chips or other items on the table) to other co-conspirators playing at the table, who were also participants in the scheme.  Collectively, the Quarterback and other players in on the scheme (i.e., the cheating team) used this information to win poker games against unwitting victims, who sometimes lost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time. The defendants used other cheating technology as well, such as a chip tray analyzer (essentially, a poker chip tray that also secretly read all cards using hidden cameras), an x-ray table that could read cards face down on the table, and special contact lenses or eyeglasses that could read pre-marked cards. ...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>
