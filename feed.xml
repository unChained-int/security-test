      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Interesting &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://restofworld.org/2025/linkedin-job-scams/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;article&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on the variety of LinkedIn job scams around the world:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In India, tech jobs are used as bait because the industry employs millions of people and offers high-paying roles. In Kenya, the recruitment industry is largely unorganized, so scamsters leverage fake personal referrals. In Mexico, bad actors capitalize on the informal nature of the job economy by advertising fake formal roles that carry a promise of security. In Nigeria, scamsters often manage to get LinkedIn users to share their login credentials with the lure of paid work, preying on their desperation amid an especially acute unemployment crisis...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

This is because SOCs are adopting AI without an intentional approach to operational integration. Some teams treat it as a shortcut for broken processes. Others attempt to apply machine learning to problems</description>

      <description>Last week’s cyber news in 2025 was not about one big incident. It was about many small cracks opening at the same time. Tools people trust every day behave in unexpected ways. Old flaws resurfaced. New ones were used almost immediately.
A common theme ran through it all in 2025. Attackers moved faster than fixes. Access meant for work, updates, or support kept getting abused. And damage did not</description>

      <title>Are We Ready to Be Governed by Artificial Intelligence?</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/are-we-ready-to-be-governed-by-artificial-intelligence.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI) overlords are a common trope in science-fiction dystopias, but the reality looks much more prosaic. The technologies of artificial intelligence are &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049948/rewiring-democracy/?ref=merionwest.com&amp;quot;&amp;gt;already pervading&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; many aspects of democratic government, affecting our lives in ways both large and small. This has occurred largely without our notice or consent. The result is a government incrementally transformed by AI rather than the singular technological overlord of the big screen.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Let us begin with the executive branch. One of the most important functions of this branch of government is to administer the law, including the human services on which so many Americans rely. Many of these programs have long been operated by a mix of humans and machines, even if not previously using modern AI tools such as ...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Friday Squid Blogging: Squid Camouflage</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/friday-squid-blogging-squid-camouflage.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-25212-z&amp;quot;&amp;gt;research&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Abstract:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; Coleoid cephalopods have the most elaborate camouflage system in the animal kingdom. This enables them to hide from or deceive both predators and prey. Most studies have focused on benthic species of octopus and cuttlefish, while studies on squid focused mainly on the chromatophore system for communication. Camouflage adaptations to the substrate while moving has been recently described in the semi-pelagic oval squid (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Sepioteuthis lessoniana&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;). Our current study focuses on the same squid&amp;amp;#8217;s complex camouflage to substrate in a stationary, motionless position. We observed disruptive, uniform, and mottled chromatic body patterns, and we identified a threshold of contrast between dark and light chromatic components that simplifies the identification of disruptive chromatic body pattern. We found that arm postural components are related to the squid position in the environment, either sitting directly on the substrate or hovering just few centimeters above the substrate. Several of these context-dependent body patterns have not yet been observed in ...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Urban VPN Proxy Surreptitiously Intercepts AI Chats</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/urban-vpn-proxy-surreptitiously-intercepts-ai-chats.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.koi.ai/blog/urban-vpn-browser-extension-ai-conversations-data-collection&amp;quot;&amp;gt;pretty scary&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Urban VPN Proxy targets conversations across ten AI platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok (xAI), Meta AI.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For each platform, the extension includes a dedicated &amp;amp;#8220;executor&amp;amp;#8221; script designed to intercept and capture conversations. The harvesting is enabled by default through hardcoded flags in the extension&amp;amp;#8217;s configuration.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is no user-facing toggle to disable this. The only way to stop the data collection is to uninstall the extension entirely.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[&amp;amp;#8230;]&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The data collection operates independently of the VPN functionality. Whether the VPN is connected or not, the harvesting runs continuously in the background...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Every year, cybercriminals find new ways to steal money and data from businesses. Breaching a business network, extracting sensitive data, and selling it on the dark web has become a reliable payday.&amp;amp;nbsp;

Eventually, Microsoft upgraded Active Directory to support the much more secure AES encryption standard. But by default, Windows servers have continued to respond to RC4-based authentication requests and return an RC4-based response. The RC4 fallback has been a favorite weakness hackers have exploited to compromise enterprise networks. Use of RC4 played a ...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>
