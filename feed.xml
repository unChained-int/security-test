      <description>New research has uncovered that publishers of over 100 Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions leaked access tokens that could be exploited by bad actors to update the extensions, posing a critical software supply chain risk.

      <title>How Attackers Bypass Synced Passkeys</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/how-attackers-bypass-synced-passkeys.html</link>
      <description>TLDR
Even if you take nothing else away from this piece, if your organization is evaluating passkey deployments, it is insecure to deploy synced passkeys.

Synced passkeys inherit the risk of the cloud accounts and recovery processes that protect them, which creates material enterprise exposure.
Adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) kits can force authentication fallbacks that circumvent strong</description>

      <title>Apple’s Bug Bounty Program</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/apples-bug-bounty-program.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Apple is now offering a &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/apple-ups-the-reward-for-finding-major-exploits-to-2-million/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;$2M&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.csoonline.com/article/4071044/apple-bumps-rce-bug-bounties-to-2m-to-counter-commercial-spyware-vendors.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;bounty&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for a zero-click exploit. According to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://security.apple.com/blog/apple-security-bounty-evolved/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;the Apple website&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today we’re announcing the next major chapter for Apple Security Bounty, featuring the industry’s highest rewards, expanded research categories, and a flag system for researchers to objectively demonstrate vulnerabilities and obtain accelerated awards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We’re doubling our top award to $2 million for exploit chains that can achieve similar goals as sophisticated mercenary spyware attacks. This is an unprecedented amount in the industry and the largest payout offered by any bounty program we’re aware of ­ and our bonus system, providing additional rewards for Lockdown Mode bypasses and vulnerabilities discovered in beta software, can more than double this reward, with a maximum payout in excess of $5 million. We’re also doubling or significantly increasing rewards in many other categories to encourage more intensive research. This includes $100,000 for a complete Gatekeeper bypass, and $1 million for broad unauthorized iCloud access, as no successful exploit has been demonstrated to date in either category.
...&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

No reviews yet, but you can read chapters &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://pghrev.com/being-a-politician/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;12&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://newpublic.substack.com/p/2ddffc17-a033-4f98-83fa-11376b30c6cd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.schneier.com/books/table-of-contents/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;43 chapters&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; total).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can order the book pretty much everywhere, and a copy signed by me &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.schneier.com/product/rewiring-democracy-hardcover/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <description>Every week, the cyber world reminds us that silence doesn’t mean safety. Attacks often begin quietly — one unpatched flaw, one overlooked credential, one backup left unencrypted. By the time alarms sound, the damage is done.
This week’s edition looks at how attackers are changing the game — linking different flaws, working together across borders, and even turning trusted tools into weapons.</description>

      <description>Think your WAF has you covered? Think again. This holiday season, unmonitored JavaScript is a critical oversight allowing attackers to steal payment data while your WAF and intrusion detection systems see nothing. With the 2025 shopping season weeks away, visibility gaps must close now.

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Two years ago, Americans anxious about the forthcoming 2024 presidential election were considering the malevolent force of an election influencer: artificial intelligence.

We can already see how different groups of political actors are approaching AI. Professional campaigners are using AI to accelerate the traditional tactics of electioneering; organizers are using it to reinvent how movements are built; and citizens are using it both to express themselves and amplify their side&amp;amp;#8217;s messaging. Because there are so few rules, and so little prospect of regulatory action, around AI&amp;amp;#8217;s role in politics, there is no oversight of these activities, and no safeguards against the dramatic potential impacts for our democracy...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Malware campaigns distributing the RondoDox botnet have expanded their targeting focus to exploit more than 50 vulnerabilities across over 30 vendors.

&amp;quot;Threat actors are authenticating into multiple accounts rapidly across compromised devices,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;The speed and scale of these attacks imply that the attackers appear to control valid credentials rather than brute-forcing.&amp;quot;

      <description>The world&amp;apos;s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&amp;amp;#038;T, Comcast and Verizon, new evidence suggests. Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet&amp;apos;s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.</description>

      <title>Autonomous AI Hacking and the Future of Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/autonomous-ai-hacking-and-the-future-of-cybersecurity.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;AI agents are now hacking computers. They&amp;amp;#8217;re getting better at all phases of cyberattacks, faster than most of us expected. They can chain together different aspects of a cyber operation, and hack autonomously, at computer speeds and scale. This is going to change everything.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Over the summer, hackers proved the concept, industry institutionalized it, and criminals operationalized it. In June, AI company XBOW took the &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-ai-xbow-tops-hackerone-us-leaderboad&amp;quot;&amp;gt;top spot&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on HackerOne&amp;amp;#8217;s US leaderboard after submitting over 1,000 new vulnerabilities in just a few months.

      <description>The SOC of 2026 will no longer be a human-only battlefield. As organizations scale and threats evolve in sophistication and velocity, a new generation of AI-powered agents is reshaping how Security Operations Centers (SOCs) detect, respond, and adapt.
But not all AI SOC platforms are created equal.
