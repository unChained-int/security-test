And the more groups of AI agents are given tasks that require cooperation and collaboration, the more those human-like dynamics emerge...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Security teams are still catching malware. The problem is what they&amp;apos;re not catching.
More attacks today don&amp;apos;t arrive as files. They don&amp;apos;t drop binaries. They don&amp;apos;t trigger classic alerts. Instead, they run quietly through tools that already exist inside the environment — scripts, remote access, browsers, and developer workflows.
That shift is creating a blind spot.

      <description>Understanding mDL credential formats Standards in the VDC Ecosystem In our first blog post in this series, we highlighted that VDCs can represent a wide range of credentials, from a driver’s license to a diploma to proof of age. The ability to use VDCs in a wide variety of use cases is a major reason why many are looking at the VDC ecosystem as technology that can change how we present identity and attributes (both in person and online). While credential variety is a good thing, interoperability requires a common set of standards and protocols for issuing, using, and verifying VDCs. The next</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We don&amp;amp;#8217;t have many &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/03/trump-venezuela-cyber-operation-maduro-00709816&amp;quot;&amp;gt;details&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;President Donald Trump suggested Saturday that the U.S. used cyberattacks or other technical capabilities to cut power off in Caracas during strikes on the Venezuelan capital that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If true, it would mark one of the most public uses of U.S. cyber power against another nation in recent memory. These operations are typically highly classified, and the U.S. is considered one of the most advanced nations in cyberspace operations globally.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>
