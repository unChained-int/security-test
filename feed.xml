      <title>Friday Squid Blogging: Squid Camouflage</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/friday-squid-blogging-squid-camouflage.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;New &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-25212-z&amp;quot;&amp;gt;research&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Abstract:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; Coleoid cephalopods have the most elaborate camouflage system in the animal kingdom. This enables them to hide from or deceive both predators and prey. Most studies have focused on benthic species of octopus and cuttlefish, while studies on squid focused mainly on the chromatophore system for communication. Camouflage adaptations to the substrate while moving has been recently described in the semi-pelagic oval squid (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Sepioteuthis lessoniana&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;). Our current study focuses on the same squid&amp;amp;#8217;s complex camouflage to substrate in a stationary, motionless position. We observed disruptive, uniform, and mottled chromatic body patterns, and we identified a threshold of contrast between dark and light chromatic components that simplifies the identification of disruptive chromatic body pattern. We found that arm postural components are related to the squid position in the environment, either sitting directly on the substrate or hovering just few centimeters above the substrate. Several of these context-dependent body patterns have not yet been observed in ...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.koi.ai/blog/urban-vpn-browser-extension-ai-conversations-data-collection&amp;quot;&amp;gt;pretty scary&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Urban VPN Proxy targets conversations across ten AI platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Grok (xAI), Meta AI.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For each platform, the extension includes a dedicated &amp;amp;#8220;executor&amp;amp;#8221; script designed to intercept and capture conversations. The harvesting is enabled by default through hardcoded flags in the extension&amp;amp;#8217;s configuration.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There is no user-facing toggle to disable this. The only way to stop the data collection is to uninstall the extension entirely.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[&amp;amp;#8230;]&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The data collection operates independently of the VPN functionality. Whether the VPN is connected or not, the harvesting runs continuously in the background...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>The Trump administration has pursued a staggering range of policy pivots this past year that threaten to weaken the nation’s ability and willingness to address a broad spectrum of technology challenges, from cybersecurity and privacy to countering disinformation, fraud and corruption. These shifts, along with the president’s efforts to restrict free speech and freedom of the press, have come at such a rapid clip that many readers probably aren’t even aware of them all.</description>

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Doublespeed, a startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) that uses a phone farm to manage at least hundreds of AI-generated social media accounts and promote products has been hacked. The hack reveals what products the AI-generated accounts are promoting, often without the required disclosure that these are advertisements, and allowed the hacker to take control of more than 1,000 smartphones that power the company.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The hacker, who asked for anonymity because he feared retaliation from the company, said he reported the vulnerability to Doublespeed on October 31. At the time of writing, the hacker said he still has access to the company&amp;amp;#8217;s backend, including the phone farm itself. ...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>
