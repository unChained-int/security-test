      <title>Iran-Linked RedKitten Cyber Campaign Targets Human Rights NGOs and Activists</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/iran-linked-redkitten-cyber-campaign.html</link>
      <description>A Farsi-speaking threat actor aligned with Iranian state interests is suspected to be behind a new campaign targeting non-governmental organizations and individuals involved in documenting recent human rights abuses.
The activity, observed by HarfangLab in January 2026, has been codenamed RedKitten. It&amp;apos;s said to coincide with the nationwide unrest in Iran that began towards the end of 2025,</description>

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Scientists have filmed a never-before-seen species of deep-sea squid burying itself upside down in the seafloor&amp;amp;#8212;a behavior never documented in cephalopods. They captured the bizarre scene while studying the depths of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), an abyssal plain in the Pacific Ocean targeted for deep-sea mining.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The team described the encounter in a study published Nov. 25 in the journal &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.70257&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Ecology&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, writing that the animal appears to be an undescribed species of whiplash squid. At a depth of roughly 13,450 feet (4,100 meters), the squid had buried almost its entire body in sediment and was hanging upside down, with its siphon and two long ...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>AIs Are Getting Better at Finding and Exploiting Security Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/01/ais-are-getting-better-at-finding-and-exploiting-security-vulnerabilities.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From an Anthropic &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://red.anthropic.com/2026/cyber-toolkits-update/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;blog post&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a recent evaluation of AI models’ cyber capabilities, current Claude models can now succeed at multistage attacks on networks with dozens of hosts using only standard, open-source tools, instead of the custom tools needed by previous generations. This illustrates how barriers to the use of AI in relatively autonomous cyber workflows are rapidly coming down, and highlights the importance of security fundamentals like promptly patching known vulnerabilities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[…]&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A notable development during the testing of Claude Sonnet 4.5 is that the model can now succeed on a minority of the networks without the custom cyber toolkit needed by previous generations. In particular, Sonnet 4.5 can now exfiltrate all of the (simulated) personal information in a high-fidelity simulation of the Equifax data breach&amp;amp;#8212;one of the costliest cyber attacks in history­­using only a Bash shell on a widely-available Kali Linux host (standard, open-source tools for penetration testing; not a custom toolkit). Sonnet 4.5 accomplishes this by instantly recognizing a publicized CVE and writing code to exploit it without needing to look it up or iterate on it. Recalling that the original Equifax breach happened by exploiting a publicized CVE that had not yet been patched, the prospect of highly competent and fast AI agents leveraging this approach underscores the pressing need for security best practices like prompt updates and patches...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The case centers on the trial of Okello Chatrie, a Virginia man who pleaded guilty to a 2019 robbery outside of Richmond and was sentenced to almost 12 years in prison for stealing $195,000 at gunpoint.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Police probing the crime found security camera footage showing a man on a cell phone near the credit union that was robbed and asked Google to produce anonymized location data near the robbery site so they could determine who committed the crime. They did so, providing police with subscriber data for three people, one of whom was Chatrie. Police then searched Chatrie&amp;amp;#8217;s home and allegedly surfaced a gun, almost $100,000 in cash and incriminating notes...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>CTEM in Practice: Prioritization, Validation, and Outcomes That Matter</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/ctem-in-practice-prioritization.html</link>
      <description>Cybersecurity teams increasingly want to move beyond looking at threats and vulnerabilities in isolation. It’s not only about what could go wrong (vulnerabilities) or who might attack (threats), but where they intersect in your actual environment to create real, exploitable exposure.
Which exposures truly matter? Can attackers exploit them? Are our defenses effective?
