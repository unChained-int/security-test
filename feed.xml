&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8220;Long before anyone had heard of Ren Zhengfei or Huawei, Wan Runnan had been China&amp;amp;#8217;s star entrepreneur in the 1980s, with his company, the Stone Group, touted as &amp;amp;#8220;China&amp;amp;#8217;s IBM.&amp;amp;#8221; Wan had believed that economic change could lead to political change. He had thrown his support behind the pro-democracy protesters in 1989. As a result, he had to flee to France, with an arrest warrant hanging over his head. He was never able to return home. Now, decades later and in failing health in Paris, Wan recalled something that had happened one day in the late 1980s, when he was still living in Beijing...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/when-your-2m-security-detection-fails.html</link>
      <description>Enterprises today are expected to have at least 6-8 detection tools, as detection is considered a standard investment and the first line of defense. Yet security leaders struggle to justify dedicating resources further down the alert lifecycle to their superiors.
As a result, most organizations&amp;apos; security investments are asymmetrical, robust detection tools paired with an under-resourced SOC,</description>

      <title>Four Ways AI Is Being Used to Strengthen Democracies Worldwide</title>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Democracy is colliding with the technologies of artificial intelligence. Judging from the audience reaction at the recent &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.coe.int/en/web/world-forum-democracy&amp;quot;&amp;gt;World Forum on Democracy&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; in Strasbourg, the general expectation is that democracy will be the worse for it. We have another narrative. Yes, there are risks to democracy from AI, but there are also opportunities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have just published the book &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049948/rewiring-democracy/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Rewiring Democracy: How AI will Transform Politics, Government, and Citizenship&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; In it, we take a clear-eyed view of how AI is undermining confidence in our information ecosystem, how the use of biased AI can harm constituents of democracies and how elected officials with authoritarian tendencies can use it to consolidate power. But we also give positive examples of how AI is transforming democratic governance and politics for the better...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
