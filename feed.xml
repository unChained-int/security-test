&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some of those living with facial differences tell WIRED they have undergone multiple surgeries and experienced stigma for their entire lives, which is now being echoed by the technology they are forced to interact with. They say they haven&amp;amp;#8217;t been able to access public services due to facial verification services failing, while others have struggled to access financial services. Social media filters and face-unlocking systems on phones often won&amp;amp;#8217;t work, they say...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Why You Should Swap Passwords for Passphrases</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/why-you-should-swap-passwords-for.html</link>
      <description>The advice didn&amp;apos;t change for decades: use complex passwords with uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. The idea is to make passwords harder for hackers to crack via brute force methods. But more recent guidance shows our focus should be on password length, rather than complexity. Length is the more important security factor, and passphrases are the simplest way to get your users to create</description>

      <description>ClickFix, FileFix, fake CAPTCHA — whatever you call it, attacks where users interact with malicious scripts in their web browser are a fast-growing source of security breaches.&amp;amp;nbsp;
ClickFix attacks prompt the user to solve some kind of problem or challenge in the browser — most commonly a CAPTCHA, but also things like fixing an error on a webpage.&amp;amp;nbsp;

      <title>Agentic AI’s OODA Loop Problem</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/agentic-ais-ooda-loop-problem.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;The OODA loop&amp;amp;#8212;for observe, orient, decide, act&amp;amp;#8212;is a framework to understand decision-making in adversarial situations. We apply the same framework to artificial intelligence agents, who have to make their decisions with untrustworthy observations and orientation. To solve this problem, we need new systems of input, processing, and output integrity.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many decades ago, U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd introduced the concept of the &amp;amp;#8220;OODA loop,&amp;amp;#8221; for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. These are the four steps of real-time continuous decision-making. Boyd developed it for fighter pilots, but it&amp;amp;#8217;s long been applied in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. An AI agent, like a pilot, executes the loop over and over, accomplishing its goals iteratively within an ever-changing environment. This is Anthropic&amp;amp;#8217;s definition: &amp;amp;#8220;Agents are models using tools in a loop.&amp;amp;#8221;...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a coordinated campaign that leveraged 131 rebranded clones of a WhatsApp Web automation extension for Google Chrome to spam Brazilian users at scale.
The 131 spamware extensions share the same codebase, design patterns, and infrastructure, according to supply chain security company Socket. The browser add-ons collectively have about 20,905 active users.
