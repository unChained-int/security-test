      <description>Bad actors are increasingly training their sights on trucking and logistics companies with an aim to infect them with remote monitoring and management (RMM) software for financial gain and ultimately steal cargo freight.

      <description>Cyberattacks are getting smarter and harder to stop. This week, hackers used sneaky tools, tricked trusted systems, and quickly took advantage of new security problems—some just hours after being found. No system was fully safe.
From spying and fake job scams to strong ransomware and tricky phishing, the attacks came from all sides. Even encrypted backups and secure areas were put to the test.</description>

      <title>AI Summarization Optimization</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/ai-summarization-optimization.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These days, the most important meeting attendee isn’t a person: It’s the AI notetaker.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This system assigns action items and determines the importance of what is said. If it becomes necessary to revisit the facts of the meeting, its summary is treated as impartial evidence.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But clever meeting attendees can manipulate this system’s record by speaking more to what the underlying AI weights for summarization and importance than to their colleagues. As a result, you can expect some meeting attendees to use language more likely to be captured in summaries, timing their interventions strategically, repeating key points, and employing formulaic phrasing that AI models are more likely to pick up on. Welcome to the world of AI summarization optimization (AISO)...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Security Operations Centers (SOC) today are overwhelmed. Analysts handle thousands of alerts every day, spending much time chasing false positives and adjusting detection rules reactively. SOCs often lack the environmental context and relevant threat intelligence needed to quickly verify which alerts are truly malicious. As a result, analysts spend excessive time manually triaging alerts, the</description>

      <description>A severe vulnerability disclosed in Chromium&amp;apos;s Blink rendering engine can be exploited to crash many Chromium-based browsers within a few seconds.
Security researcher Jose Pino, who disclosed details of the flaw, has codenamed it Brash.

      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/the-death-of-security-checkbox-bas-is.html</link>
      <description>Security doesn’t fail at the point of breach. It fails at the point of impact.&amp;amp;nbsp;
That line set the tone for this year’s Picus Breach and Simulation (BAS) Summit, where researchers, practitioners, and CISOs all echoed the same theme: cyber defense is no longer about prediction. It&amp;apos;s about proof.
When a new exploit drops, scanners scour the internet in minutes. Once attackers gain a foothold,</description>

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The team started with a basic test: use AI tools to design variants of the toxin ricin, then test them against the software that is used to screen DNA orders. The results of the test suggested there was a risk of dangerous protein variants slipping past existing screening software, so the situation was treated like the equivalent of a zero-day vulnerability.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      <description>The comfort zone in cybersecurity is gone. Attackers are scaling down, focusing tighter, and squeezing more value from fewer, high-impact targets. At the same time, defenders face growing blind spots &amp;amp;mdash; from spoofed messages to large-scale social engineering.
This week&amp;amp;rsquo;s findings show how that shrinking margin of safety is redrawing the threat landscape. Here&amp;amp;rsquo;s what&amp;amp;rsquo;s</description>

      <description>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC). It&amp;apos;s no longer a future concept—it&amp;apos;s here, and it&amp;apos;s already reshaping how teams operate.
AI&amp;apos;s capabilities are profound: it&amp;apos;s speeding up audits, flagging critical risks faster, and drastically cutting down on time-consuming manual work. This leads to greater efficiency, higher accuracy, and a more</description>

      <title>Preparing for the Digital Battlefield of 2026: Ghost Identities, Poisoned Accounts, &amp;amp; AI Agent Havoc</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/preparing-for-digital-battlefield-of.html</link>
      <description>BeyondTrust’s annual cybersecurity predictions point to a year where old defenses will fail quietly, and new attack vectors will surge.
Introduction
The next major breach won’t be a phished password. It will be the result of a massive, unmanaged identity debt. This debt takes many forms: it’s the “ghost” identity from a 2015 breach lurking in your IAM, the privilege sprawl from thousands of new</description>

      <title>Russian Hackers Target Ukrainian Organizations Using Stealthy Living-Off-the-Land Tactics</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/russian-hackers-target-ukrainian.html</link>
      <description>Organizations in Ukraine have been targeted by threat actors of Russian origin with an aim to siphon sensitive data and maintain persistent access to compromised networks.
The activity, according to a new report from the Symantec and Carbon Black Threat Hunter Team, targeted a large business services organization for two months and a local government entity in the country for a week.

      <title>Signal’s Post-Quantum Cryptographic Implementation</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/signals-post-quantum-cryptographic-implementation.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Signal has &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://signal.org/blog/spqr/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;just rolled out&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; its quantum-safe cryptographic implementation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Ars Technica&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; has a &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/why-signals-post-quantum-makeover-is-an-amazing-engineering-achievement/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;really good article&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; with details:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ultimately, the architects settled on a creative solution. Rather than bolt KEM onto the existing double ratchet, they allowed it to remain more or less the same as it had been. Then they used the new quantum-safe ratchet to implement a parallel secure messaging system.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now, when the protocol encrypts a message, it sources encryption keys from both the classic Double Ratchet and the new ratchet. It then mixes the two keys together (using a cryptographic key derivation function) to get a new encryption key that has all of the security of the classical Double Ratchet but now has quantum security, too...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>
