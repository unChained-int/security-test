      <title>Shai-Hulud v2 Campaign Spreads From npm to Maven, Exposing Thousands of Secrets</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/shai-hulud-v2-campaign-spreads-from-npm.html</link>
      <description>The second wave of the Shai-Hulud supply chain attack has spilled over to the Maven ecosystem after compromising more than 830 packages in the npm registry.
The Socket Research Team said it identified a Maven Central package named org.mvnpm:posthog-node:4.18.1 that embeds the same two components associated with Sha1-Hulud: the &amp;quot;setup_bun.js&amp;quot; loader and the main payload &amp;quot;bun_environment.js.&amp;quot;

      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/meet-rey-the-admin-of-scattered-lapsus-hunters/</link>
      <description>A prolific cybercriminal group that calls itself &amp;quot;Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters&amp;quot; made headlines regularly this year by stealing data from and publicly mass extorting dozens of major corporations. But the tables seem to have turned somewhat for &amp;quot;Rey,&amp;quot; the moniker chosen by the technical operator and public face of the hacker group: Earlier this week, Rey confirmed his real life identity and agreed to an interview after KrebsOnSecurity tracked him down and contacted his father.</description>

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8220;Long before anyone had heard of Ren Zhengfei or Huawei, Wan Runnan had been China&amp;amp;#8217;s star entrepreneur in the 1980s, with his company, the Stone Group, touted as &amp;amp;#8220;China&amp;amp;#8217;s IBM.&amp;amp;#8221; Wan had believed that economic change could lead to political change. He had thrown his support behind the pro-democracy protesters in 1989. As a result, he had to flee to France, with an arrest warrant hanging over his head. He was never able to return home. Now, decades later and in failing health in Paris, Wan recalled something that had happened one day in the late 1980s, when he was still living in Beijing...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>Enterprises today are expected to have at least 6-8 detection tools, as detection is considered a standard investment and the first line of defense. Yet security leaders struggle to justify dedicating resources further down the alert lifecycle to their superiors.
As a result, most organizations&amp;apos; security investments are asymmetrical, robust detection tools paired with an under-resourced SOC,</description>

      <title>Four Ways AI Is Being Used to Strengthen Democracies Worldwide</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/four-ways-ai-is-being-used-to-strengthen-democracies-worldwide.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Democracy is colliding with the technologies of artificial intelligence. Judging from the audience reaction at the recent &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.coe.int/en/web/world-forum-democracy&amp;quot;&amp;gt;World Forum on Democracy&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; in Strasbourg, the general expectation is that democracy will be the worse for it. We have another narrative. Yes, there are risks to democracy from AI, but there are also opportunities.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We have just published the book &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049948/rewiring-democracy/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Rewiring Democracy: How AI will Transform Politics, Government, and Citizenship&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; In it, we take a clear-eyed view of how AI is undermining confidence in our information ecosystem, how the use of biased AI can harm constituents of democracies and how elected officials with authoritarian tendencies can use it to consolidate power. But we also give positive examples of how AI is transforming democratic governance and politics for the better...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/is-your-android-tv-streaming-box-part-of-a-botnet/</link>
      <description>On the surface, the Superbox media streaming devices for sale at retailers like BestBuy and Walmart may seem like a steal: They offer unlimited access to more than 2,200 pay-per-view and streaming services like Netflix, ESPN and Hulu, all for a one-time fee of around $400. But security experts warn these TV boxes require intrusive software that forces the user&amp;apos;s network to relay Internet traffic for others, traffic that is often tied to cybercrime activity such as advertising fraud and account takeovers.</description>

This aspect of Helios&amp;amp;#8217; design ensures that no two trustees could collude to determine the outcome of an election or the contents of individual votes on their own: all trustees must provide their decryption shares...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>AI as Cyberattacker</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/ai-as-cyberattacker.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Anthropic&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In mid-September 2025, we detected suspicious activity that later investigation determined to be a highly sophisticated espionage campaign. The attackers used AI’s “agentic” capabilities to an unprecedented degree­&amp;amp;#8212;using AI not just as an advisor, but to execute the cyberattacks themselves.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The threat actor&amp;amp;#8212;­whom we assess with high confidence was a Chinese state-sponsored group&amp;amp;#8212;­manipulated our Claude Code tool into attempting infiltration into roughly thirty global targets and succeeded in a small number of cases. The operation targeted large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturing companies, and government agencies. We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>In March 2024, Mozilla said it was winding down its collaboration with Onerep -- an identity protection service offered with the Firefox web browser that promises to remove users from hundreds of people-search sites -- after KrebsOnSecurity revealed Onerep&amp;apos;s founder had created dozens of people-search services and was continuing to operate at least one of them. Sixteen months later, however, Mozilla is still promoting Onerep. This week, Mozilla announced their partnership with Onerep will officially end next month.</description>

      <description>Cybersecurity researchers have warned of an actively expanding botnet dubbed Tsundere that&amp;apos;s targeting Windows users.
Active since mid-2025, the threat is designed to execute arbitrary JavaScript code retrieved from a command-and-control (C2) server, Kaspersky researcher Lisandro Ubiedo said in an analysis published today.

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Google has filed a complaint in court that &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/google-vows-to-stop-scam-e-z-pass-and-usps-texts-plaguing-americans/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;details the scam&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In a complaint filed Wednesday, the tech giant accused &amp;amp;#8220;a cybercriminal group in China&amp;amp;#8221; of selling &amp;amp;#8220;phishing for dummies&amp;amp;#8221; kits. The kits help unsavvy fraudsters easily “execute a large-scale phishing campaign,” tricking hordes of unsuspecting people into “disclosing sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or banking information, often by impersonating well-known brands, government agencies, or even people the victim knows.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;These branded &amp;amp;#8220;Lighthouse&amp;amp;#8221; kits offer two versions of software, depending on whether bad actors want to launch SMS and e-commerce scams. &amp;amp;#8220;Members may subscribe to weekly, monthly, seasonal, annual, or permanent licenses,&amp;amp;#8221; Google alleged. Kits include &amp;amp;#8220;hundreds of templates for fake websites, domain set-up tools for those fake websites, and other features designed to dupe victims into believing they are entering sensitive information on a legitimate website.&amp;amp;#8221;...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>
