      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Social media has been a familiar, even mundane, part of life for nearly two decades. It can be easy to forget it was not always that way.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 2008, social media was just emerging into the mainstream. &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://thefulcrum.us/media-technology/news-literacy-project&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Facebook&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; reached &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.cnet.com/culture/facebook-hits-100-million-users/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;100 million users&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that summer. And a singular candidate was integrating social media into his political campaign: Barack Obama. His campaign&amp;amp;#8217;s use of social media was so bracingly innovative, so impactful, that it was viewed by journalist &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.technologyreview.com/2008/08/19/219185/how-obama-really-did-it-2/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;David Talbot&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and others as the strategy that enabled the first term Senator to win the White House...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/learn-how-leading-companies-secure.html</link>
      <description>You’ve probably already moved some of your business to the cloud—or you’re planning to. That’s a smart move. It helps you work faster, serve your customers better, and stay ahead.
But as your cloud setup grows, it gets harder to control who can access what.

      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/beyond-iam-silos-why-identity-security.html</link>
      <description>Identity security fabric (ISF) is a unified architectural framework that brings together disparate identity capabilities. Through ISF, identity governance and administration (IGA), access management (AM), privileged access management (PAM), and identity threat detection and response (ITDR) are all integrated into a single, cohesive control plane.

      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/microsoft-patch-tuesday-november-2025-edition/</link>
      <description>Microsoft this week pushed security updates to fix more than 60 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and supported software, including at least one zero-day bug that is already being exploited. Microsoft also fixed a glitch that prevented some Windows 10 users from taking advantage of an extra year of security updates, which is nice because the zero-day flaw and other critical weaknesses patched today affect all versions of Windows, including Windows 10.</description>

      <title>Friday Squid Blogging: Pilot Whales Eat a Lot of Squid</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/friday-squid-blogging-pilot-whales-eat-a-lot-of-squid.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Short-finned pilot wales (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Globicephala macrorhynchus&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;) eat &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://gizmodo.com/scientists-wanted-to-know-how-many-squid-pilot-whales-eat-each-day-what-they-found-was-astounding-2000685522&amp;quot;&amp;gt;at lot&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of squid:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To figure out a short-finned pilot whale&amp;amp;#8217;s caloric intake, Gough says, the team had to combine data from a variety of sources, including movement data from short-lasting tags, daily feeding rates from satellite tags, body measurements collected via aerial drones, and sifting through the stomachs of unfortunate whales that ended up stranded on land.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once the team pulled all this data together, they estimated that a typical whale will eat between 82 and 202 squid a day. To meet their energy needs, a whale will have to consume an average of 140 squid a day. Annually, that&amp;amp;#8217;s about 74,000 squid per whale. For all the whales in the area, that amounts to about 88,000 tons of squid eaten every year...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>The Iranian state-sponsored threat actor known as APT42 has been observed targeting individuals and organizations that are of interest to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as part of a new espionage-focused campaign.

      <title>The Role of Humans in an AI-Powered World</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/the-role-of-humans-in-an-ai-powered-world.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As AI capabilities grow, we must delineate the roles that should remain exclusively human. The line seems to be between fact-based decisions and judgment-based decisions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example, in a medical context, if an AI was demonstrably better at reading a test result and diagnosing cancer than a human, you would take the AI in a second. You want the more accurate tool. But justice is harder because justice is inherently a human quality in a way that &amp;amp;#8220;Is this tumor cancerous?&amp;amp;#8221; is not. That&amp;amp;#8217;s a fact-based question. &amp;amp;#8220;What&amp;amp;#8217;s the right thing to do here?&amp;amp;#8221; is a human-based question...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;The Business of Secrets: Adventures in Selling Encryption Around the World&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt; by Fred Kinch (May 24, 2024)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From the vantage point of today, it&amp;amp;#8217;s surreal reading about the commercial cryptography business in the 1970s. Nobody knew anything. The manufacturers didn&amp;amp;#8217;t know whether the cryptography they sold was any good. The customers didn&amp;amp;#8217;t know whether the crypto they bought was any good. Everyone pretended to know, thought they knew, or knew better than to even try to know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;The Business of Secrets&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt; is the self-published memoirs of Fred Kinch.

      <title>When Attacks Come Faster Than Patches: Why 2026 Will be the Year of Machine-Speed Security</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/when-attacks-come-faster-than-patches.html</link>
      <description>The Race for Every New CVE
Based on multiple 2025 industry reports: roughly 50 to 61 percent of newly disclosed vulnerabilities saw exploit code weaponized within 48 hours. Using the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a reference, hundreds of software flaws are now confirmed as actively targeted within days of public disclosure. Each new announcement now triggers a global race</description>

      <title>On Hacking Back</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/on-hacking-back.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Former DoJ attorney John Carlin &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.aspendigital.org/blog/so-you-want-to-hack-back/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;writes&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; about hackback, which he defines thus: &amp;amp;#8220;A hack back is a type of cyber response that incorporates a counterattack designed to proactively engage with, disable, or collect evidence about an attacker. Although hack backs can take on various forms, they are&amp;amp;#8212;­by definition­&amp;amp;#8212;not passive defensive measures.&amp;amp;#8221;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;His conclusion:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As the law currently stands, specific forms of purely defense measures are authorized so long as they affect only the victim’s system or data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the other end of the spectrum, offensive measures that involve accessing or otherwise causing damage or loss to the hacker’s systems are likely prohibited, absent government oversight or authorization. And even then parties should proceed with caution in light of the heightened risks of misattribution, collateral damage, and retaliation...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>
