&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;China is already the world&amp;amp;#8217;s largest exporter of AI powered surveillance technology; new surveillance technologies and platforms developed in China are also not likely to simply stay there. By exposing the full scope of China&amp;amp;#8217;s AI driven control apparatus, this report presents clear, evidence based insights for policymakers, civil society, the media and technology companies seeking to counter the rise of AI enabled repression and human rights violations, and China&amp;amp;#8217;s growing efforts to project that repression beyond its borders...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I have no context for &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1pg0ujj/new_rare_footage_of_a_live_giant_squid_caught/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;this video&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8212;it&amp;amp;#8217;s from Reddit&amp;amp;#8212;but one of the commenters adds some context:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hey everyone, squid biologist here! Wanted to add some stuff you might find interesting.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With so many people carrying around cameras, we&amp;amp;#8217;re getting more videos of giant squid at the surface than in previous decades. We&amp;amp;#8217;re also starting to notice a pattern, that around this time of year (peaking in January) we see a bunch of giant squid around Japan. We don&amp;amp;#8217;t know why this is happening. Maybe they gather around there to mate or something? who knows! but since so many people have cameras, those one-off monster-story encounters are now caught on video, like this one (which, btw, rips. This squid looks so healthy, it&amp;amp;#8217;s awesome)...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>Building Trustworthy AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/building-trustworthy-ai-agents.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The promise of personal AI assistants rests on a dangerous assumption: that we can trust systems we haven’t made trustworthy. We can’t. And today’s versions are failing us in predictable ways: pushing us to do things against our own best interests, gaslighting us with doubt about things we are or that we know, and being unable to distinguish between who we are and who we have been. They struggle with incomplete, inaccurate, and partial context: with no standard way to move toward accuracy, no mechanism to correct sources of error, and no accountability when wrong information leads to bad decisions...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
