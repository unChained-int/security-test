      <description>ClickFix, FileFix, fake CAPTCHA — whatever you call it, attacks where users interact with malicious scripts in their web browser are a fast-growing source of security breaches.&amp;amp;nbsp;
ClickFix attacks prompt the user to solve some kind of problem or challenge in the browser — most commonly a CAPTCHA, but also things like fixing an error on a webpage.&amp;amp;nbsp;
The name is a little misleading, though</description>

      <title>Agentic AI’s OODA Loop Problem</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/agentic-ais-ooda-loop-problem.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;The OODA loop&amp;amp;#8212;for observe, orient, decide, act&amp;amp;#8212;is a framework to understand decision-making in adversarial situations. We apply the same framework to artificial intelligence agents, who have to make their decisions with untrustworthy observations and orientation. To solve this problem, we need new systems of input, processing, and output integrity.&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many decades ago, U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd introduced the concept of the &amp;amp;#8220;OODA loop,&amp;amp;#8221; for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. These are the four steps of real-time continuous decision-making. Boyd developed it for fighter pilots, but it&amp;amp;#8217;s long been applied in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. An AI agent, like a pilot, executes the loop over and over, accomplishing its goals iteratively within an ever-changing environment. This is Anthropic&amp;amp;#8217;s definition: &amp;amp;#8220;Agents are models using tools in a loop.&amp;amp;#8221;...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We pointed a commercial-off-the-shelf satellite dish at the sky and carried out the most comprehensive public study to date of geostationary satellite communication. A shockingly large amount of sensitive traffic is being broadcast unencrypted, including critical infrastructure, internal corporate and government communications, private citizens&amp;amp;#8217; voice calls and SMS, and consumer Internet traffic from in-flight wifi and mobile networks. This data can be passively observed by anyone with a few hundred dollars of consumer-grade hardware. There are thousands of geostationary satellite transponders globally, and data from a single transponder may be visible from an area as large as 40% of the surface of the earth...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

According to &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://security.apple.com/blog/apple-security-bounty-evolved/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;the Apple website&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Today we’re announcing the next major chapter for Apple Security Bounty, featuring the industry’s highest rewards, expanded research categories, and a flag system for researchers to objectively demonstrate vulnerabilities and obtain accelerated awards.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;We’re doubling our top award to $2 million for exploit chains that can achieve similar goals as sophisticated mercenary spyware attacks. This is an unprecedented amount in the industry and the largest payout offered by any bounty program we’re aware of ­ and our bonus system, providing additional rewards for Lockdown Mode bypasses and vulnerabilities discovered in beta software, can more than double this reward, with a maximum payout in excess of $5 million. We’re also doubling or significantly increasing rewards in many other categories to encourage more intensive research. This includes $100,000 for a complete Gatekeeper bypass, and $1 million for broad unauthorized iCloud access, as no successful exploit has been demonstrated to date in either category.
...&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My latest book, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;, will be published in just over a week. No reviews yet, but you can read chapters &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://pghrev.com/being-a-politician/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;12&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://newpublic.substack.com/p/2ddffc17-a033-4f98-83fa-11376b30c6cd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;34&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; (of &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.schneier.com/books/table-of-contents/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;43 chapters&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; total).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can order the book pretty much everywhere, and a copy signed by me &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.schneier.com/product/rewiring-democracy-hardcover/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;here&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Please help spread the word. I want this book to make a splash when it&amp;amp;#8217;s public. Leave a review on whatever site you buy it from. Or make a TikTok video. Or do whatever you kids do these days. Is anyone a Slashdot contributor? I&amp;amp;#8217;d like the book to be announced there...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>⚡ Weekly Recap: WhatsApp Worm, Critical CVEs, Oracle 0-Day, Ransomware Cartel &amp;amp; More</title>
      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/weekly-recap-whatsapp-worm-critical.html</link>
      <description>Every week, the cyber world reminds us that silence doesn’t mean safety. Attacks often begin quietly — one unpatched flaw, one overlooked credential, one backup left unencrypted. By the time alarms sound, the damage is done.
This week’s edition looks at how attackers are changing the game — linking different flaws, working together across borders, and even turning trusted tools into weapons.</description>

      <description>Think your WAF has you covered? Think again. This holiday season, unmonitored JavaScript is a critical oversight allowing attackers to steal payment data while your WAF and intrusion detection systems see nothing.

      <title>AI and the Future of American Politics</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/ai-and-the-future-of-american-politics.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Two years ago, Americans anxious about the forthcoming 2024 presidential election were considering the malevolent force of an election influencer: artificial intelligence. Over the past several years, we have seen &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.cigionline.org/articles/then-and-now-how-does-ai-electoral-interference-compare-in-2025/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;plenty&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2025.1569115/full&amp;quot;&amp;gt;of&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/technology/ai-elections-democracy.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;warning&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/643ecb10be528d2c1da863cb/682f5ae442fffdff819ef830_TP%202025.2.pdf&amp;quot;&amp;gt;signs&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; from elections worldwide demonstrating how AI can be used to propagate misinformation and alter the political landscape, whether by &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/us/politics/trump-meme-trolls-2024.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;trolls&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on social media, &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.npr.org/2024/08/17/nx-s1-5079397/openai-chatgpt-iranian-group-us-election&amp;quot;&amp;gt;foreign&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2025/02/07/algorithmic-invasions-how-information-warfare-threatens-nato-s-eastern-flank/index.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;influencers&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, or even a &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democratic-operative-admits-commissioning-fake-biden-robocall-used-ai-rcna140402&amp;quot;&amp;gt;street magician&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democratic-operative-admits-commissioning-fake-biden-robocall-used-ai-rcna140402&amp;quot;&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; AI is poised to play a more volatile role than ever before in America&amp;amp;#8217;s next federal election in 2026. We can already see how different groups of political actors are approaching AI. Professional campaigners are using AI to accelerate the traditional tactics of electioneering; organizers are using it to reinvent how movements are built; and citizens are using it both to express themselves and amplify their side&amp;amp;#8217;s messaging. Because there are so few rules, and so little prospect of regulatory action, around AI&amp;amp;#8217;s role in politics, there is no oversight of these activities, and no safeguards against the dramatic potential impacts for our democracy...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>The world&amp;apos;s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&amp;amp;#038;T, Comcast and Verizon, new evidence suggests. Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet&amp;apos;s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.</description>
