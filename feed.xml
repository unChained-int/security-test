      <title>Microsoft Patch Tuesday, November 2025 Edition</title>
      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/microsoft-patch-tuesday-november-2025-edition/</link>
      <description>Microsoft this week pushed security updates to fix more than 60 vulnerabilities in its Windows operating systems and supported software, including at least one zero-day bug that is already being exploited. Microsoft also fixed a glitch that prevented some Windows 10 users from taking advantage of an extra year of security updates, which is nice because the zero-day flaw and other critical weaknesses patched today affect all versions of Windows, including Windows 10.</description>

      <title>Friday Squid Blogging: Pilot Whales Eat a Lot of Squid</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/friday-squid-blogging-pilot-whales-eat-a-lot-of-squid.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Short-finned pilot wales (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Globicephala macrorhynchus&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;) eat &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://gizmodo.com/scientists-wanted-to-know-how-many-squid-pilot-whales-eat-each-day-what-they-found-was-astounding-2000685522&amp;quot;&amp;gt;at lot&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of squid:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To figure out a short-finned pilot whale&amp;amp;#8217;s caloric intake, Gough says, the team had to combine data from a variety of sources, including movement data from short-lasting tags, daily feeding rates from satellite tags, body measurements collected via aerial drones, and sifting through the stomachs of unfortunate whales that ended up stranded on land.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once the team pulled all this data together, they estimated that a typical whale will eat between 82 and 202 squid a day. To meet their energy needs, a whale will have to consume an average of 140 squid a day. Annually, that&amp;amp;#8217;s about 74,000 squid per whale. For all the whales in the area, that amounts to about 88,000 tons of squid eaten every year...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>The Role of Humans in an AI-Powered World</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/the-role-of-humans-in-an-ai-powered-world.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As AI capabilities grow, we must delineate the roles that should remain exclusively human. The line seems to be between fact-based decisions and judgment-based decisions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example, in a medical context, if an AI was demonstrably better at reading a test result and diagnosing cancer than a human, you would take the AI in a second. You want the more accurate tool. But justice is harder because justice is inherently a human quality in a way that &amp;amp;#8220;Is this tumor cancerous?&amp;amp;#8221; is not. That&amp;amp;#8217;s a fact-based question. &amp;amp;#8220;What&amp;amp;#8217;s the right thing to do here?&amp;amp;#8221; is a human-based question...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;The Business of Secrets: Adventures in Selling Encryption Around the World&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt; by Fred Kinch (May 24, 2024)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From the vantage point of today, it&amp;amp;#8217;s surreal reading about the commercial cryptography business in the 1970s. Nobody knew anything. The manufacturers didn&amp;amp;#8217;t know whether the cryptography they sold was any good. The customers didn&amp;amp;#8217;t know whether the crypto they bought was any good. Everyone pretended to know, thought they knew, or knew better than to even try to know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;The Business of Secrets&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt; is the self-published memoirs of Fred Kinch. He was founder and vice president of&amp;amp;#8212;mostly sales&amp;amp;#8212;at a US cryptographic hardware company called Datotek, from company&amp;amp;#8217;s founding in 1969 until 1982. It&amp;amp;#8217;s mostly a disjointed collection of stories about the difficulties of selling to governments worldwide, along with descriptions of the highs and (mostly) lows of foreign airlines, foreign hotels, and foreign travel in general. But it&amp;amp;#8217;s also about encryption...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
