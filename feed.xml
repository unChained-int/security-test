      <title>AI vs. Human Drivers</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/ai-vs-human-drivers.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Two competing arguments are making the rounds. The first is by a neurosurgeon in the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;New York Times&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;. In &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://archive.is/YDBDz&amp;quot;&amp;gt;an op-ed&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; that honestly sounds like it was paid for by Waymo, the author calls driverless cars a &amp;amp;#8220;public health breakthrough&amp;amp;#8221;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In medical research, there’s a practice of ending a study early when the results are too striking to ignore. We stop when there is unexpected harm. We also stop for overwhelming benefit, when a treatment is working so well that it would be unethical to continue giving anyone a placebo. When an intervention works this clearly, you change what you do...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <link>https://thehackernews.com/2025/12/how-to-streamline-zero-trust-using.html</link>
      <description>Zero Trust helps organizations shrink their attack surface and respond to threats faster, but many still struggle to implement it because their security tools don’t share signals reliably. 88% of organizations admit they’ve suffered significant challenges in trying to implement such approaches, according to Accenture. When products can’t communicate, real-time access decisions break down.

      <title>Substitution Cipher Based on The Voynich Manuscript</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/substitution-cipher-based-on-the-voynich-manuscript.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Here&amp;amp;#8217;s a fun paper: &amp;amp;#8220;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01611194.2025.2566408&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The Naibbe cipher: a substitution cipher that encrypts Latin and Italian as Voynich Manuscript-like ciphertext&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;amp;#8220;:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Abstract:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; In this article, I investigate the hypothesis that the Voynich Manuscript (MS 408, Yale University Beinecke Library) is compatible with being a ciphertext by attempting to develop a historically plausible cipher that can replicate the manuscript’s unusual properties. The resulting cipher­a verbose homophonic substitution cipher I call the Naibbe cipher­can be done entirely by hand with 15th-century materials, and when it encrypts a wide range of Latin and Italian plaintexts, the resulting ciphertexts remain fully decipherable and also reliably reproduce many key statistical properties of the Voynich Manuscript at once. My results suggest that the so-called &amp;amp;#8220;ciphertext hypothesis&amp;amp;#8221; for the Voynich Manuscript remains viable, while also placing constraints on plausible substitution cipher structures...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>The holiday season compresses risk into a short, high-stakes window. Systems run hot, teams run lean, and attackers time automated campaigns to get maximum return.

      <title>Friday Squid Blogging: Vampire Squid Genome</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/friday-squid-blogging-vampire-squid-genome.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The vampire squid (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Vampyroteuthis infernalis&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;) has the &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.sciencealert.com/vampire-squid-from-hell-reveals-the-ancient-origins-of-octopuses&amp;quot;&amp;gt;largest cephalopod genome&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; ever sequenced: more than 11 billion base pairs. That&amp;amp;#8217;s more than twice as large as the biggest squid genomes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It&amp;amp;#8217;s technically not a squid: &amp;amp;#8220;The vampire squid is a fascinating twig tenaciously hanging onto the cephalopod family tree. It&amp;amp;#8217;s neither a squid nor an octopus (nor a vampire), but rather the last, lone remnant of an ancient lineage whose other members have long since vanished.&amp;amp;#8221;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven&amp;amp;#8217;t covered...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>
