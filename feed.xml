      <title>Friday Squid Blogging: Pilot Whales Eat a Lot of Squid</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/friday-squid-blogging-pilot-whales-eat-a-lot-of-squid.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Short-finned pilot wales (&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Globicephala macrorhynchus&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;) eat &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://gizmodo.com/scientists-wanted-to-know-how-many-squid-pilot-whales-eat-each-day-what-they-found-was-astounding-2000685522&amp;quot;&amp;gt;at lot&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of squid:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;To figure out a short-finned pilot whale&amp;amp;#8217;s caloric intake, Gough says, the team had to combine data from a variety of sources, including movement data from short-lasting tags, daily feeding rates from satellite tags, body measurements collected via aerial drones, and sifting through the stomachs of unfortunate whales that ended up stranded on land.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once the team pulled all this data together, they estimated that a typical whale will eat between 82 and 202 squid a day. To meet their energy needs, a whale will have to consume an average of 140 squid a day. Annually, that&amp;amp;#8217;s about 74,000 squid per whale. For all the whales in the area, that amounts to about 88,000 tons of squid eaten every year...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>The Role of Humans in an AI-Powered World</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/the-role-of-humans-in-an-ai-powered-world.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As AI capabilities grow, we must delineate the roles that should remain exclusively human. The line seems to be between fact-based decisions and judgment-based decisions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For example, in a medical context, if an AI was demonstrably better at reading a test result and diagnosing cancer than a human, you would take the AI in a second. You want the more accurate tool. But justice is harder because justice is inherently a human quality in a way that &amp;amp;#8220;Is this tumor cancerous?&amp;amp;#8221; is not. That&amp;amp;#8217;s a fact-based question. &amp;amp;#8220;What&amp;amp;#8217;s the right thing to do here?&amp;amp;#8221; is a human-based question...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;The Business of Secrets: Adventures in Selling Encryption Around the World&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt; by Fred Kinch (May 24, 2024)&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;From the vantage point of today, it&amp;amp;#8217;s surreal reading about the commercial cryptography business in the 1970s. Nobody knew anything. The manufacturers didn&amp;amp;#8217;t know whether the cryptography they sold was any good. The customers didn&amp;amp;#8217;t know whether the crypto they bought was any good. Everyone pretended to know, thought they knew, or knew better than to even try to know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;The Business of Secrets&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt; is the self-published memoirs of Fred Kinch. He was founder and vice president of&amp;amp;#8212;mostly sales&amp;amp;#8212;at a US cryptographic hardware company called Datotek, from company&amp;amp;#8217;s founding in 1969 until 1982. It&amp;amp;#8217;s mostly a disjointed collection of stories about the difficulties of selling to governments worldwide, along with descriptions of the highs and (mostly) lows of foreign airlines, foreign hotels, and foreign travel in general. But it&amp;amp;#8217;s also about encryption...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>On Hacking Back</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/on-hacking-back.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Former DoJ attorney John Carlin &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.aspendigital.org/blog/so-you-want-to-hack-back/&amp;quot;&amp;gt;writes&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; about hackback, which he defines thus: &amp;amp;#8220;A hack back is a type of cyber response that incorporates a counterattack designed to proactively engage with, disable, or collect evidence about an attacker. Although hack backs can take on various forms, they are&amp;amp;#8212;­by definition­&amp;amp;#8212;not passive defensive measures.&amp;amp;#8221;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;His conclusion:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As the law currently stands, specific forms of purely defense measures are authorized so long as they affect only the victim’s system or data.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;At the other end of the spectrum, offensive measures that involve accessing or otherwise causing damage or loss to the hacker’s systems are likely prohibited, absent government oversight or authorization. And even then parties should proceed with caution in light of the heightened risks of misattribution, collateral damage, and retaliation...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <title>New Attacks Against Secure Enclaves</title>
      <link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/new-attacks-against-secure-enclaves.html</link>
      <description>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Encryption can protect data at rest and data in transit, but does nothing for data in use. What we have are secure enclaves. I&amp;amp;#8217;ve &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/2023/12/decoupling-for-security.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;written about&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; this before:&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Almost all cloud services have to perform some computation on our data. Even the simplest storage provider has code to copy bytes from an internal storage system and deliver them to the user. End-to-end encryption is sufficient in such a narrow context. But often we want our cloud providers to be able to perform computation on our raw data: search, analysis, AI model training or fine-tuning, and more. Without expensive, esoteric techniques, such as secure multiparty computation protocols or homomorphic encryption techniques that can perform calculations on encrypted data, cloud servers require access to the unencrypted data to do anything useful...&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;</description>

      <link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/11/drilling-down-on-uncle-sams-proposed-tp-link-ban/</link>
      <description>The U.S. government is reportedly preparing to ban the sale of wireless routers and other networking gear from TP-Link Systems, a tech company that currently enjoys an estimated 50% market share among home users and small businesses. Experts say while the proposed ban may have more to do with TP-Link&amp;apos;s ties to China than any specific technical threats, much of the rest of the industry serving this market also sources hardware from China and ships products that are insecure fresh out of the box.</description>
